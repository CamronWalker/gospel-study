        "full_markdown": "Brothers and sisters, I have learned a painful lesson since I last occupied this pulpit in October of 2022. That lesson is: if you don\u2019t give an acceptable talk, you can be banned for the next several conferences. You can see I am assigned early in the first session of this one. What you can\u2019t see is that I am positioned on a trapdoor with a very delicate latch. If this talk doesn\u2019t go well, I won\u2019t see you for another few conferences.\nIn the spirit of that beautiful hymn with this beautiful choir, I *have* learned some lessons recently that, with the Lord\u2019s help, I wish to share with you today. That will make this a very personal talk.\nThe most personal and painful of all these recent experiences has been the passing of my beloved wife, Pat. She *was* the greatest woman I have ever known\u2014a perfect wife and mother, to say nothing of her purity, her gift of expression, her spirituality. She gave a talk once titled \u201cFulfilling the Measure of Your Creation.\u201d It seems to me that she fulfilled the measure of *her* creation more successfully than anyone could have dreamed possible. She was a complete daughter of God, an exemplary woman of Christ. I was the most fortunate of men to spend 60 years of my life with her. Should I prove worthy, our sealing means I can spend eternity with her.\nAnother experience began 48 hours after my wife\u2019s burial. At that time, I was rushed to the hospital in an acute medical crisis. I then spent the first four weeks of a six-week stay in and out of intensive care and in and out of consciousness.\nVirtually all my experience *in* the hospital during that first period is lost to my memory. What is *not* lost is my memory of a journey *outside* the hospital, out to what seemed the edge of eternity. I cannot speak fully of that experience here, but I can say that part of what I received was an admonition to return to my ministry with more urgency, more consecration, more focus on the Savior, more faith in His word.\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel I was receiving my own personal version of a revelation given to the Twelve nearly 200 years ago:\n\u201cThou shalt bear record of my name \u2026 [and] send forth my word unto the ends of the earth.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;Morning by morning; and day after day let thy warning voice go forth; and when the night cometh let not the inhabitants of the earth slumber, because of thy speech.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cArise[,] \u2026 take up your cross, [and] follow me.\u201d\nMy beloved sisters and brothers, since that experience, I have tried to take up my cross more earnestly, with more resolve to find where I can raise an apostolic voice of both warmth and warning in the morning, during the day, and into the night.\nThat leads me to a *third* truth that came in those months of loss, illness, and distress. It was a renewed witness of and endless gratitude for the resolute prayers of this Church\u2014your prayers\u2014of which I have been the beneficiary. I will be eternally grateful for the supplication of thousands of people who, like the importuning widow, repeatedly sought heaven\u2019s intervention in my behalf. I received priesthood blessings, and I saw my high school class fast for me, as did several random wards across the Church. And my name must have been on the prayer roll of virtually every temple in the Church.\nIn my profound gratitude for all this, I join G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton, who said once \u201cthat thanks are the highest form of thought; and \u2026 gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.\u201d With my own \u201chappiness doubled by wonder,\u201d I thank all of you and thank my Father in Heaven, who heard your prayers and blessed my life.\nBrothers and sisters, I testify that God hears *every* prayer we offer and responds to each of them according to the path He has outlined for our perfection. I recognize that at roughly the same time so many were praying for the restoration of my health, an equal number\u2014including me\u2014were praying for the restoration of my wife\u2019s health. I testify that both of those prayers were heard *and* answered by a divinely compassionate Heavenly Father, even if the prayers for Pat were *not* answered the way I asked. It is for reasons known only to God why prayers are answered differently than we hope\u2014but I promise you they *are* heard and they *are* answered according to His unfailing love and cosmic timetable.\nIf we \u201cask not amiss,\u201d there are no limits to when, where, or about what we should pray. According to the revelations, we are to \u201cpray always.\u201d We are to pray, Amulek said, for \u201cthose who are around you,\u201d with the belief that the \u201cfervent prayer of a righteous [people] availeth much.\u201d Our prayers ought to be vocal when we have the privacy to so offer them. If that is not practical, they should be carried as silent utterances in our heart. We sing that prayers are \u201cmotion[s] of a hidden fire,\u201d always to be offered, according to the Savior Himself, to God the Eternal Father in the name of His Only Begotten Son.\nMy beloved friends, our prayers are our sweetest hour, our most \u201csincere desire,\u201d our simplest, purest form of worship. We should pray individually, in our families, and in congregations of all sizes. We are to employ prayer as a shield against temptation, and if there be any time we feel *not* to pray, we can be sure that hesitancy does *not* come from God, who yearns to communicate with His children at any and all times. Indeed, some efforts to keep us from praying come directly from the adversary. When we don\u2019t know how or exactly for what to pray, we should begin, and continue, until the Holy Spirit guides us into the prayer we should be offering. This approach may be the one we have to invoke when praying for our enemies and those who despitefully use us.\nUltimately, we can look to the example of the Savior, who prayed so very, very often. But it has always been intriguing to me that Jesus felt the need to pray at all. Wasn\u2019t He perfect? About what did He need to pray? Well, I have come to realize that He too, with us, wanted to \u201cseek [the Father\u2019s] face, believe his word, and trust his grace.\u201d Time after time, He retreated from society to be alone before piercing heaven with His prayers. At other times, He prayed in the company of a few companions. Then He would seek heaven on behalf of multitudes who would cover a hillside. Sometimes prayer glorified His clothing. Sometimes it glorified His countenance. Sometimes He stood to pray, sometimes He knelt, and at least once He fell on His face in prayer.\nLuke describes Jesus\u2019s descent into His expiation as requiring Him to pray \u201cmore earnestly.\u201d How does one who was perfect pray more earnestly? We assume that all of His prayers were earnest, yet in fulfilling His atoning sacrifice and through the pain that attended its universal reach, He felt to pray ever more pleadingly, with the weight of His offering finally bringing blood from every pore.\nAgainst that backdrop of Christ\u2019s victory over death and His recent gift to me of a few more weeks or months in mortality, I bear solemn witness of the reality of eternal life and the need for us to be serious in our planning for it.\nI bear witness that when Christ comes, He needs to recognize us\u2014not as nominal members listed on a faded baptismal record but as thoroughly committed, faithfully believing, covenant-keeping disciples. This is an urgent matter for all of us, lest we ever hear with devastating regret: \u201cI never knew you,\u201d or, as Joseph Smith translated that phrase, \u201c[You] never knew me.\u201d\nFortunately, we have help for this task\u2014lots of help. We need to believe in angels and miracles and the promises of the holy priesthood. We need to believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost, the influence of good families and friends, and the power of the pure love of Christ. We need to believe in revelation and prophets, seers, and revelators and President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson. We need to believe that with prayer and pleading and personal righteousness, we really can ascend to \u201cMount Zion, \u2026 the city of the living God, the heavenly place, the holiest of all.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, as we repent of our sins and come boldly to the \u201cthrone of grace,\u201d leaving before Him there our alms and our heartfelt supplications, we will find mercy and compassion and forgiveness at the benevolent hands of our Eternal Father and His obedient, perfectly pure Son. Then, with Job and all the refined faithful, we will behold a world \u201ctoo wonderful\u201d to understand. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "As my two youngest children were growing, I discovered books that were entertaining and engaging but also used symbolism in their stories. As we read together in the evenings, I loved helping my children understand the symbolism the author was using to teach deeper principles, even gospel principles.\nI knew this was sinking in one day when my younger son was in his early teens. He had started a new book and just wanted to enjoy the story, but his mind kept trying to find the deeper meaning in everything he was reading. He was frustrated, but I was smiling inside.\nJesus taught through stories and symbols\u2014a mustard seed to teach the power of faith, a lost sheep to teach the worth of souls, a prodigal son to teach the character of God. His parables were symbols through which He could teach deeper lessons to those who had \u201cears to hear.\u201d But those not seeking the deeper meaning would not understand, just as many who read those same books I read to my children never knew there were deeper meanings and so much more to get out of those stories.\nWhen God the Father offered His Only Begotten Son as a sacrifice for us, Jesus Christ Himself became the highest symbol of our Father in Heaven\u2019s undying love for each of us. Jesus Christ became the Lamb of God.\nWe have the privilege and blessing of being invited into a covenant relationship with God, in which our own lives can become a symbol of that covenant. Covenants create the kind of relationship that allows God to mold and change us over time and lift us to become more like the Savior, drawing us closer and closer to Him and our Father and eventually preparing us to enter Their presence.\nEach person on earth is a beloved son or daughter of God. When we choose to be part of a covenant, it enhances and deepens our relationship with Him. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught that when we choose to make covenants with God, our relationship with Him can become much closer than it was before our covenant, and it enables Him to bless us with an extra measure of His mercy and love, a covenantal love referred to as *hesed* in the Hebrew language. The covenant path is all about our relationship with God\u2014our *hesed* relationship with Him.\nOur Father wants a deeper relationship with all His sons and daughters, but it is our choice. As we choose to draw nearer to Him through a *covenant* relationship, it allows Him to draw nearer to us and more fully bless us.\nGod sets the conditions and obligations of the covenants we make. When we choose to enter into that relationship, we witness to Him, through the symbolic actions of each covenant, that we are willing to abide by the conditions He has set. Through honoring our covenants, we enable God to pour out the multitude of promised blessings associated with those covenants, including increased power to change and become more like our Savior. Jesus Christ is at the center of all covenants we make, and covenant blessings are made possible because of His atoning sacrifice.\nBaptism by immersion is the symbolic gate through which we enter into a covenant relationship with God. Being immersed in the water and coming up again is symbolic of the Savior\u2019s death and Resurrection to new life. As we are baptized, we symbolically die and are born again into the family of Christ and show we are willing to take His name upon us. We ourselves embody that covenant symbolism. In the New Testament we read, \u201cFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.\u201d With our baptism we symbolically put on Christ.\nThe ordinance of the sacrament also points to the Savior. The bread and water are symbolic of Christ\u2019s flesh and blood shed for us. The gift of His Atonement is symbolically offered to us each week when a priesthood holder, representing the Savior Himself, offers us the bread and water. As we perform the action of eating and drinking the emblems of His flesh and blood, Christ symbolically becomes a part of us. We again put on Christ as we make a new covenant each week.\nAs we make covenants with God in the house of the Lord, we further deepen our relationship with Him. Everything we do in the temple points to our Father\u2019s plan for us, at the heart of which is the Savior and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord will teach us line upon line through the symbolism of the ordinances and covenants as we open our hearts and prayerfully seek to understand the deeper meanings.\nAs part of the temple endowment, we are *authorized* to wear the garment of the holy priesthood. It is both a sacred obligation and a sacred privilege.\nIn many religious traditions, special outer clothing is worn as a symbol of a person\u2019s beliefs and commitment to God, and ceremonial clothing is often worn by those leading worship services. Those sacred vestments carry deep meaning for those who wear them. We read in scripture that in ancient times, sacred ceremonial clothing was also worn in conjunction with temple rituals.\nAs members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, those of us who have chosen to make covenants with God in the house of the Lord wear sacred ceremonial outer clothing during temple worship, symbolic of the clothing worn in ancient temple rituals. We also wear the garment of the holy priesthood, both during temple worship *and* in our everyday lives.\nThe garment of the holy priesthood is deeply symbolic and *also* points to the Savior. When Adam and Eve partook of the fruit and had to leave the Garden of Eden, they were given coats of skins as a covering for them. It is likely that an animal was sacrificed to make those coats of skins\u2014symbolic of the Savior\u2019s own sacrifice for us. *Kaphar* is the basic Hebrew word for atonement, and one of its meanings is \u201cto cover.\u201d Our temple garment reminds us that the Savior and the blessings of His Atonement cover us throughout our lives. As we put on the garment of the holy priesthood each day, that beautiful symbol becomes a part of us.\nIn the New Testament book of Romans, we read: \u201cThe night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. \u2026 Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nI am so grateful for the privilege of wearing the garment of the holy priesthood to remind me that the Savior and the blessings of His infinite Atonement constantly cover me throughout my mortal journey. It also reminds me that as I keep the covenants I have made with God in the house of the Lord, I have symbolically put on Christ, who Himself is an armor of light. He will protect me from evil, give me power and increased capacity, and be my light and guide through the darkness and difficulties of this world.\nThere is deep and beautiful symbolic meaning in the garment of the holy priesthood and its relationship to Christ. I believe that my willingness to wear the holy garment becomes *my* symbol to Him. It is my own personal sign to God, not a sign to others.\nI am so grateful for my Savior, Jesus Christ. His atoning sacrifice for us became the greatest symbol of His and our Father in Heaven\u2019s infinite love for each of us, with the tangible symbols of that love and sacrifice\u2014the marks in the Savior\u2019s hands, feet, and side\u2014remaining even after His Resurrection.\nAs I keep my covenants and obligations with God, including wearing the garment of the holy priesthood, my very life can become a personal symbol of my love and deep gratitude for my Savior, Jesus Christ, and my desire to have Him with me always.\nIf you have not yet done so, I invite you to choose a deeper relationship with God by making covenants with Him in the house of the Lord. Study the talks of our prophet (including the beautiful teachings in the footnotes of his talks, which most conference talks have). He has spoken repeatedly about covenants for years and especially since becoming President of the Church. Learn from his teachings about the beautiful blessings and increased power and capacity that can be yours through making and keeping covenants with God.\n\nThe General Handbook states that it is not required to have a mission call or be engaged to be married to make temple covenants. A person must be at least 18&nbsp;years old, no longer be attending high school or the equivalent, and be a member of the Church for at least one year. There are also standards of personal holiness required. If you have the desire to deepen your relationship with your Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ by making sacred covenants in the house of the Lord, I invite you to speak with your bishop or branch president and let him know of your desires. He will help you know how to prepare to receive and honor those covenants.\nThrough a covenant relationship with God, our own lives can become a living symbol of our commitment to and deep love for our Father in Heaven, our *hesed* for Him, and our desire to progress and eventually become like our Savior, being prepared to one day enter Their presence. I testify that the great blessings of that covenant relationship are well worth the price. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

I pray that I can provide some peace and assurance.\nThe Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ began with an explosion of light and truth! A teenage boy in upstate New York, with the very ordinary name of Joseph Smith, enters a grove of trees to pray. He\u2019s worried about his soul and his standing before God. He seeks forgiveness for his sins. And he\u2019s confused about which church to join. He needs clarity and peace\u2014he needs light and knowledge.\nAs Joseph kneels to pray and \u201coffer up the desires of [his] heart to God,\u201d a thick darkness envelops him. Something evil, oppressive, and very real tries to stop him\u2014to bind his tongue so he cannot speak. The forces of darkness get so intense that Joseph thinks he\u2019s going to die. But he \u201cexert[s] all [his] powers to call upon God to deliver [him] out of the power of this enemy which [has] seized upon [him].\u201d And then, \u201cat the very moment when [he\u2019s] ready to sink into despair and abandon [him]self to destruction,\u201d when he doesn\u2019t know if he can hang on any longer, a glorious brilliance fills the grove, scattering the darkness and the enemy of his soul.\nA \u201cpillar of light\u201d brighter than the sun gradually descends upon him. One personage appears, and then another. Their \u201cbrightness and glory defy all description.\u201d The first, our Heavenly Father, speaks his name, \u201cpointing to the other\u2014[Joseph!] *This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*\u201d\nAnd with that overwhelming burst of light and truth, the Restoration has begun. A veritable flood of divine revelation and blessings will follow: new scripture, restored priesthood keys, apostles and prophets, ordinances and covenants, and the reestablishment of the Lord\u2019s true and living Church, which will someday fill the earth with the light and witness of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel.\nAll that, and much more, began with a boy\u2019s desperate prayer and a pillar of light.\nWe too have our own desperate needs. We too need freedom from spiritual confusion and worldly darkness. We too need to know for ourselves. That is one reason President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has invited us to \u201cimmerse [ourselves] in the glorious light of the Restoration.\u201d\nOne of the great truths of the Restoration is that the heavens are open\u2014that we too can receive light and knowledge from on high. I testify that is true.\nBut we must be wary of a spiritual trap. Sometimes faithful Church members become discouraged and even drift away because they haven\u2019t had overwhelming spiritual experiences\u2014because they haven\u2019t experienced their own pillar of light. President Spencer&nbsp;W. Kimball warned, \u201cAlways expecting the spectacular, many will miss entirely the constant flow of revealed communication.\u201d\nPresident Joseph&nbsp;F. Smith likewise recalled, \u201cThe Lord withheld marvels from me [when I was young], and showed me the truth, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.\u201d\nThat is the Lord\u2019s typical pattern, brothers and sisters. Rather than sending us a pillar of light, the Lord sends us a ray of light, and then another, and another.\nThose rays of light are continuously being poured down upon us. The scriptures teach that Jesus Christ \u201cis the light and \u2026 life of the world,\u201d that His \u201cSpirit giveth light to every man [and woman] that cometh into the world,\u201d and that His light \u201cfill[s] the immensity of space,\u201d giving \u201clife to all things.\u201d The Light of Christ is literally all around us.\nIf we have received the gift of the Holy Ghost and are striving to exercise faith, repent, and honor our covenants, then we are worthy to receive these divine rays constantly. In Elder David&nbsp;A. Bednar\u2019s memorable phrase, \u201cwe are \u2018living in revelation.\u2019\u201d\nAnd yet, every one of us is different. No two people experience God\u2019s light and truth in exactly the same way. Take some time to think about how you experience the light and Spirit of the Lord.\nYou may have experienced these bursts of light and testimony as \u201cpeace [spoken] to your mind concerning [a] matter\u201d that has worried you.\nOr as an impression\u2014a still, small voice\u2014that settled \u201cin your mind and in your heart\u201d and urged you to do something good, such as helping someone.\nPerhaps you\u2019ve been in a class at church\u2014or at a youth camp\u2014and felt a strong desire to follow Jesus Christ and stay faithful. Maybe you even stood and shared a testimony that you hoped was true and then felt it was.\nOr maybe you\u2019ve been praying and felt a joyful assurance that God loves you.\nYou may have heard someone bear testimony of Jesus Christ, and it touched your heart and filled you with hope.\nPerhaps you were reading in the Book of Mormon and a verse spoke to your soul, as if God had put it there just for you\u2014and then you realized that He did.\nYou may have felt the love of God for others as you served them.\nOr maybe you struggle to feel the Spirit in the moment because of depression or anxiety but have the precious gift and the faith to look back and recognize past \u201ctender mercies of the Lord.\u201d\nMy point is that there are many ways to receive heavenly rays of testimony. These are just a few, of course. They may not be dramatic, but all of them form part of our testimonies.\nBrothers and sisters, I have not seen a pillar of light, but, like you, I have experienced many divine rays. Over the years, I\u2019ve tried to treasure such experiences. I find that as I do, I recognize and remember even more of them. Here are some examples from my own life. They may not be very impressive to some, but they are precious to me.\nI remember being a rowdy teenager at a baptism. As the meeting was about to begin, I felt the Spirit urge me to sit down and be reverent. I sat down and stayed quiet the rest of the meeting.\nBefore my mission, I was afraid my testimony wasn\u2019t strong enough. No one in my family had ever served a mission, and I didn\u2019t know if I could do it. I remember studying and praying desperately to receive a more certain witness of Jesus Christ. Then one day, as I pled with Heavenly Father, I felt a powerful sense of light and warmth. And I knew. I just knew.\nI remember being awakened one night years later by a feeling of \u201cpure intelligence\u201d telling me I would be called to serve in the elders quorum. Two weeks later I was called.\nI remember a general conference where a beloved member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles spoke the exact words of testimony I had told a friend I hoped to hear.\nI remember kneeling with hundreds of brethren to pray for a dear friend who lay unconscious on a ventilator in a small, faraway hospital after his heart had stopped. As we united our own hearts to plead for his life, he woke up and pulled the ventilator out of his own throat. He serves today as a stake president.\nAnd I remember waking up with strong spiritual feelings after a vivid dream of a dear friend and mentor who passed away far too early, leaving an enormous hole in my life. He was smiling and joyful. I knew he was OK.\nThese are some of my rays. You have had your own experiences\u2014your own light-filled bursts of testimony. As we recognize, remember, and gather these rays \u201ctogether in one,\u201d something wonderful and powerful begins to happen. \u201cLight cleaveth unto light\u201d\u2014\u201ctruth embraceth truth.\u201d The reality and power of one ray of testimony reinforces and combines with another, and then another, and another. Line upon line, precept upon precept, here a ray and there a ray\u2014one small, treasured spiritual moment at a time\u2014there grows up within us a core of light-filled, spiritual experiences. Perhaps no one ray is strong enough or bright enough to constitute a full testimony, but together they can become a light that the darkness of doubt cannot overcome.\n\u201cO then, is not this real?\u201d Alma asks. \u201cI say unto you, Yea, because it is light.\u201d\n\u201cThat which is of God is light,\u201d the Lord teaches us, \u201cand he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.\u201d\nThat means, brothers and sisters, that in time and through \u201cgreat diligence,\u201d we too can have our own pillar of light\u2014one ray at a time. And in the midst of that pillar, we too will find a loving Heavenly Father calling us by name, pointing us to our Savior, Jesus Christ, and inviting us to \u201cHear Him!\u201d\nI bear witness of Jesus Christ, that He is the light and life of the whole world\u2014and of your personal world and mine.\nI testify that He is the true and living Son of the true and living God and that He stands at the head of this true and living Church, guided and directed by His true and living prophets and apostles.\nMay we recognize and receive His glorious light and then choose Him over the darkness of the world\u2014always and forever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

By the whisperings of the still small voice of the Spirit of the living God, he gave to me the testimony I possess.

        "full_markdown": "My beloved brothers and sisters, I pray that we may be spiritually renewed by the inspired messages from our leaders this weekend and rejoice in what I love to call \u201ccovenant confidence through Jesus Christ.\u201d This confidence is the quiet yet certain assurance of receiving the blessings that God promises for those who keep their covenants and is so needed amid the challenging circumstances of our day.\nThe construction of new houses of the Lord across the world, under the inspired leadership of President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, has caused great rejoicing among Church members and serves as an important symbol of the expansion of the Lord\u2019s kingdom.\nReflecting on my awe-inspiring experience at the dedication of the Feather River California Temple last October, I wondered if sometimes we get lost in the excitement of having new temples in our cities and communities and neglect the holier purpose of the sacred covenants made in the temple.\nInscribed on the front of each temple is a solemn statement: \u201cHoliness to the Lord.\u201d These inspired words are a clear invitation that when we enter the Lord\u2019s house, we embark on a sacred journey of learning to become higher and holier disciples of Christ. As we make covenants in holiness before God and commit to follow the Savior, we receive the power to change our hearts, renew our spirits, and deepen our relationship with Him. Such an endeavor brings sanctification to our souls and forms a sacred bond with God and Jesus Christ, who promise that we can inherit the gift of eternal life. The result of this sacred journey is that we obtain a holier and higher confidence for our day-to-day lives within our covenants made through Jesus Christ.\nSuch confidence is the pinnacle of our divine connection with God and can help us increase our devotion to and gratitude for Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. It fortifies our ability to love and serve others, and it strengthens our souls to live in an unholy world that is increasingly dark and discouraging. It empowers us to overcome the seeds of doubt and despair, fear and frustration, heartache and hopelessness that the enemy tries to drive deep into our hearts, especially when life is hard, trials are long, or circumstances are difficult. A biblical verse offers sound advice for each of us as we lean into the stiff wind of today\u2019s worldly challenges: \u201cCast not away therefore your confidence.\u201d\nDear brothers and sisters, those who gain genuine confidence in the covenants made in the house of the Lord through Jesus Christ possess one of the most powerful forces that we can access in this life.\nAs we have studied the Book of Mormon in Come, Follow Me this year, we have witnessed how Nephi beautifully exemplified the power of this type of covenant confidence through his faithfulness when he faced setbacks and challenges, like getting the plates as commanded by the Lord. Nephi, despite being exceedingly sorrowful for the fear and lack of faith of Laman and Lemuel, remained confident that the Lord would deliver the plates to them. He said unto his brothers, \u201cAs the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.\u201d Because of Nephi\u2019s confidence in the Lord\u2019s promises, he was able to accomplish what he had been commanded to do. Later, in his vision, Nephi beheld the influence of this type of confidence, writing, \u201cI, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, \u2026 and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.\u201d\nI have seen firsthand the Lord\u2019s loving promises and power flowing into the lives of God\u2019s children, strengthening them to face life\u2019s circumstances. The other day my wife came home after her worship in the temple and told me how deeply touched she was by what she experienced there. As she entered the house of the Lord, she saw a man in a wheelchair moving very slowly and a woman walking with great difficulty using a cane, both courageously coming to worship the Lord in His house. As my wife walked into the initiatory area, she saw a sweet sister who was missing one arm\u2014and had only part of another arm\u2014beautifully and celestially performing any tasks she was given.\nAs my wife and I talked about that experience, we concluded that only pure and heartfelt confidence in the eternal promises God provides through the holy covenants made with Him in His house could cause those marvelous disciples of Christ to leave their homes on that very freezing day, despite their personal life circumstances.\nMy dear friends, if there is one thing we could possess\u2014and one thing we could pass on to our children and grandchildren that would help each in the tests and trials ahead\u2014it would be confidence in the covenants made through Jesus Christ. Obtaining such a divine possession will help them live as the Lord promised His faithful followers: \u201cMy disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved.\u201d\nHow do we gain such confidence through Jesus Christ? It comes through humility, centering our lives on the Savior, living by the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, receiving the ordinances of salvation and exaltation, and honoring the covenants we make with God in His holy house.\nIn his closing remarks at the October 2019 general conference, our dear prophet reminded us about an important step in achieving covenant confidence, saying: \u201cIndividual worthiness to enter the Lord\u2019s house requires much individual spiritual preparation. \u2026 Individual worthiness requires a total conversion of mind and heart to be more like the Lord, to be an honest citizen, to be a better example, and to be a holier person.\u201d Therefore, if we change our preparation to enter the temple, we will change our experience in the temple, which will transform our lives outside of the temple. \u201cThen shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.\u201d\nA bishop I know refers to the oldest class in Primary not as a \u201cPrimary\u201d class but as a \u201ctemple preparation\u201d class. In January the bishop has the class members and their teachers come to his office, where they talk about how they will spend the entire year preparing to enter the temple. The bishop takes time to go through the applicable temple recommend interview questions, which are then included in their Primary lessons. He invites the children to be prepared so that when they come to the bishop\u2019s office in one year, they will be confident, covenant confident, ready to receive a temple recommend and enter the Lord\u2019s house. This year the bishop had four young girls who were so excited, prepared, and confident to go to the temple that they wanted the bishop to print their recommends on New Year\u2019s Day at 12:01 a.m.\nPreparation isn\u2019t just for those going to the temple for the first time. We all should be perpetually preparing to go to the house of the Lord. One stake I know has adopted the motto \u201cHome centered, Church supported, and temple bound.\u201d *Bound* is an interesting word in that it means focused on a direction, but it also means fastened to or secured by, resolved and determined, sure. So being temple bound secures us to the Savior, giving us proper direction and stability while ensuring we have covenant confidence through Jesus Christ. Therefore, all of us should intentionally enhance such binding by having our next appointment scheduled with the Lord in His holy house, whether the temple is near or far away.\nOur dear prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, reminds us about these vital principles by saying: \u201cThe temple lies at the center of strengthening our faith and spiritual fortitude because the Savior and His doctrine are the very heart of the temple. Everything taught in the temple, through instruction and through the Spirit, increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. His essential ordinances bind us to Him through sacred priesthood covenants. Then, as we keep our covenants, He endows us with *His* healing, strengthening power. And oh, how we will need His power in the days ahead.\u201d\nThe Savior desires that we become prepared to understand, with great clarity, exactly how to act as we make covenants with our Heavenly Father in His name. He wants us to be prepared to experience our privileges, promises, and responsibilities; to be prepared to have the spiritual insights and awakenings that we need in this life. I know that when the Lord sees even a spark of desire or a flicker of righteous effort in our willingness to center our lives on Him and on the ordinances and covenants we make in His house, He will bless us, in His perfect way, with the miracles and tender mercies we need.\nThe house of the Lord is where we can be transformed in higher and holier ways. So, when we walk out of the temple, transformed by our hope in the promises of the covenants, armed with power from on high, we take the temple with us into our homes and lives. I assure you that having the spirit of the Lord\u2019s house in us changes us, completely.\n\nWe also know from the temple that if we want the Spirit of the Lord to be unrestrained in our lives, we simply cannot and must not have unkind feelings toward anyone. Giving place in our hearts or minds for unkind feelings or thoughts will produce unkind words and actions, whether on social media or in our homes, causing the Spirit of the Lord to withdraw from our hearts. Therefore, please cast not away your confidence, but rather, let your confidence wax strong.\nThe ongoing and accelerating building of temples will continue to excite, inspire, and bless us. Yet more important, as we change our preparation to enter the temple, we will change our experience in the temple, which will transform our lives outside of the temple. May this transformation fill us with confidence in our holy covenants made with God through Jesus Christ. God lives, Jesus is our Savior, and this is His restored Church on earth. I reverently declare these truths in the sacred name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.",

He said unto his brothers, \u201cAs the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.\u201d Because of Nephi\u2019s confidence in the Lord\u2019s promises, he was able to accomplish what he had been commanded to do.

        "full_markdown": "In the closing hours of the Savior\u2019s ministry, He went to the Mount of Olives into a garden called Gethsemane and invited His disciples to wait. Now alone, He petitioned His Father, \u201cIf thou be willing, remove this cup from me.\u201d Being in agony, His suffering caused Him, \u201ceven God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore,&nbsp;\u2026 and would that [He] might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.\u201d Yet in the moment of deep despair, the Savior did not shrink \u201cbut partook and finished [His] preparations unto the children of men.\u201d\nAs the Only Begotten of the Father, Jesus Christ had power over death, pain, and suffering but did not shrink. He fulfilled the covenant He had made with His Father and, in doing so, manifested a Christlike attribute increasingly important in the world in which we live\u2014the attribute of integrity. He remained true to God, to each of us, and to His divine identity.\n\n\nIntegrity\n\nJesus Christ is our Exemplar. Living a life of integrity requires us to be true to God, to each other, and to our divine identity. Integrity flows from the first great commandment to love God. Because you love God, you are true to Him at all times. You understand that there is right and wrong and there is absolute truth\u2014God\u2019s truth. Integrity means we do not lower our standards or behavior to impress or to be accepted by others. You \u201cdo what is right\u201d and \u201clet the consequence follow.\u201d Recent revisions to the Preach My Gospel missionary manual notably added integrity as a Christlike attribute.\nA number of years ago, Elder Uchtdorf was assigned to reorganize our stake. During our interview, he asked me a question I have not forgotten: \u201cHas there been anything in your life that, if brought to the attention of the public, would be an embarrassment to you or the Church?\u201d Surprised, my mind quickly raced over my entire life, trying to recall those moments when I may have fallen short and asking myself, \u201cIf others knew everything I had done, what would they think of me or the Church?\u201d\nIn the moment, I thought Elder Uchtdorf was only asking about worthiness, but I\u2019ve come to understand it was really a question about integrity. Was I true to what I professed? Would the world see consistency between my words and my deeds? Would others see God through my conduct?\n\nPresident Spencer&nbsp;W. Kimball taught, \u201cIntegrity\u201d is our \u201cwillingness and ability to live by our beliefs and commitments.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrue to God\n\nA life of integrity requires us to first and foremost be true to God.\nFrom our early childhood, we learned the story of Daniel in the lions\u2019 den. Daniel was always true to God. His jealous peers \u201csought to find occasion against [him]\u201d and contrived a decree mandating prayers to their gods alone. Daniel knew of the decree but went home and\u2014with \u201chis windows being open\u201d\u2014knelt and prayed three times a day to the God of Israel. As a result, Daniel was cast into the lions\u2019 den. On the morn, the king found Daniel\u2019s God had delivered him and issued a new decree that all should \u201ctremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God.\u201d\nThe king came to know God through Daniel\u2019s integrity. Others see God through ours\u2014words and deeds. Just like Daniel, being true to God will increasingly set us apart from the world.\nThe Savior reminds us, \u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson counseled: \u201c[Overcoming the world] means overcoming the temptation to care more about the things of this world than the things of God. It means trusting the doctrine of Christ more than the philosophies of men.\u201d Likewise, we must resist the temptation to walk \u201cin [our] own way, and after the image of [our] own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world.\u201d\nThe oppositional pull of this world is an essential part of God\u2019s plan of salvation. How we respond to the pull is the essence of who we are\u2014a measure of our integrity. The worldly pull can be as direct as to destroy fidelity in marriage or as subtle as posting anonymous comments critical of Church doctrine or culture. Exercising integrity in our choices is an outward expression of an inner commitment to follow the Savior Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nTrue to Others\n\nJust as integrity flows from the first great commandment to love God, being true to each other flows from the second, to love our neighbors as ourselves. A life of integrity is not a life of perfection; it is a life in which we strive every day to foremost be true to God and within that context to be true to others. President Oaks reminds us, \u201cOur zeal to keep [the] second commandment must not cause us to forget the first.\u201d\nThe world increasingly grapples with integrity by imposing codes of conduct or ethical rules that govern the relationships between people and institutions. While good, these rules are generally not anchored in absolute truth and tend to evolve based on cultural acceptance. Similar to the question posed by Elder Uchtdorf, some organizations train employees to consider what their decisions or decision-making process would look like if published online or on the front page of a major newspaper. As the Church comes out of obscurity and darkness, we, like Daniel, must rise above the worldly expectations and become the face of the true and living God at all times and in all places.\nSaying we have integrity is insufficient if our actions are inconsistent with our words. Likewise, Christian kindness is not a substitute for integrity. As a covenant people, and as leaders of His Church, we must be beyond reproach and aligned with the standards the Lord has set.\nActing with integrity builds faith and trust and reassures others that we seek only to do the will of the Lord. In our councils, we resist outside influences and follow the Lord\u2019s revealed process, seeking insights from each woman and man and acting consistent with the inspired counsel received.\nOur focus is on the Savior, and we are careful to avoid actions that may be perceived as serving our own interests, benefiting our family, or favoring someone at the expense of another. We go out of our way to avoid any perception that our actions may be influenced by the honors of men, to receive personal recognition, generate more likes, be quoted or published.\n\n\n\nTrue to Our Divine Identity\n\nFinally, a life of integrity requires us to be true to our divine identity.\nWe know some who were not.

Of course, with four young boys in our home at the time, our temple trip could be only accomplished with the help of a courageous babysitter! We left our precious children in her care and made the short, 30-minute drive.\nOur experience in the temple that day was wonderful, as it always was. However, after the conclusion of the temple sealing\u2014and as we were preparing to return home\u2014we noticed many temple workers and patrons nervously conversing in the lobby of the temple. Within moments, one of the temple workers told us that the newly constructed Teton Dam in eastern Idaho had collapsed! More than 80 billion gallons (300 million cubic meters) of water were flowing through the dam and into the 300 square miles (775 square km) of neighboring valleys. Much of the city of Rexburg was underwater, with homes and vehicles carried away by floodwaters. Two-thirds of the 9,000 residents were suddenly homeless.\nAs you might imagine, our thoughts and concerns turned to the safety of our dear children, hundreds of college students and faculty, and a community we loved. We were less than 30 miles (50 km) from home, and yet on this day, long before cell phones and text messaging, we had no way of communicating immediately with our children, nor could we make the drive from Idaho Falls to Rexburg, as all the roads had been closed.\nOur only option was to stay the night in a local motel in Idaho Falls. Kathy and I knelt together in our motel room and humbly pleaded with Heavenly Father for the safety of our dear children and the thousands of others affected by the tragic event. I recall Kathy pacing the floors into the early hours of the morning with worry about her children. Despite my own concerns, I was able to put my mind at ease and fall asleep.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long thereafter that my sweet eternal companion woke me and said, \u201cHal, how can you sleep at a time like this?\u201d\nThese words then came clearly to my heart and mind. I said to my wife: \u201cKathy, whatever the outcome, all will be well because of the temple. We have made covenants with God and have been sealed as an eternal family.\u201d\nAt that moment, it was as if the Spirit of the Lord confirmed in our hearts and minds what we both already knew to be true: the sealing ordinances, found only in the house of the Lord and administered by proper priesthood authority, had bound us together as husband and wife, and our children had been sealed to us. There truly was no need to fear, and we were grateful later to learn that our boys were safe.\nPerhaps this statement from President Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson best illustrates what Kathy and I felt on that unforgettable night. \u201cAs we attend the temple, there can come to us a dimension of spirituality and a feeling of *peace*. \u2026 We will grasp the true meaning of the words of the Savior when He said: \u2018Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. \u2026 Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid [[[John 14|John 14:27]]].\u2019\u201d\nI have been blessed to feel that peace every time I enter the sacred temple. I recall the first day I walked into the Salt Lake Temple. I was a young man.\nI looked up at a high white ceiling that made the room so light it seemed almost as if it were open to the sky. And in that moment, the thought came into my mind in clear words: \u201cI have been in this lighted place before.\u201d But then immediately there came into my mind, not in my own voice, these words: \u201cNo, you have never been here before. You are remembering a moment before you were born. You were in a sacred place like this where the Lord could come.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, I humbly testify that as we attend the temple, we can be reminded of the eternal nature of our spirits, our relationship with the Father and His divine Son, and our ultimate desire to return to our heavenly home.\nIn recent conference addresses, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught:\n\u201cThe safest place to be *spiritually* is living *inside* your temple covenants!\u201d\n\u201c*Everything* we believe and *every* promise God has made to His covenant people come together in the temple.\u201d\n\u201cEach person who makes covenants \u2026 in temples\u2014and keeps them\u2014has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nHe also taught that \u201conce we make a covenant with God, we leave neutral ground forever. God will not abandon His relationship with those who have forged such a bond with Him. In fact, all those who have made a covenant with God have access to a special kind of love and mercy.\u201d\nUnder President Nelson\u2019s inspired leadership, the Lord has accelerated, and will continue to accelerate, the building of temples across the world. This will allow all of God\u2019s children the opportunity to receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation and to make and keep sacred covenants. Qualifying to make sacred covenants is not a one-time effort but a lifetime pattern. The Lord has said it will take our full heart, might, mind, and strength.\nFrequent participation in the ordinances of the temple can create a pattern of devotion to the Lord. When you keep your temple covenants and remember them, you invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost to both strengthen and purify you.\nYou may then experience a feeling of light and hope testifying that the promises are true. You will come to know that every covenant with God is an opportunity to draw closer to Him, which will then create a desire in your heart to keep temple covenants.\nWe have been promised, \u201cBecause of our covenant with God, He will never tire in His efforts to help us, and we will never exhaust His merciful patience with us.\u201d\nIt is through the sealing covenants in the temple that we can receive the assurance of loving family connections that will continue after death and last for eternity. Honoring marriage and family covenants made in temples of God will provide protection from the evil of selfishness and pride.\nConsistent care of brothers and sisters for each other will come only with persistent efforts to lead your family in the Lord\u2019s way. Give children opportunities to pray for each other. Discern quickly the beginnings of discord, and positively recognize acts of unselfish service, especially to one another. When siblings pray for each other and serve each other, hearts will be softened and turned to each other and to their parents.\nIn part, that is what is described by Malachi as he foretold of the coming of the prophet Elijah: \u201cHe shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.\u201d\nTrials, challenges, and heartaches will surely come to all of us. None of us are immune from \u201cthorns of the flesh.\u201d Yet, as we attend the temple and remember our covenants, we can prepare to receive personal direction from the Lord.\nWhen Kathy and I were married and sealed in the Logan Utah Temple, then-Elder Spencer&nbsp;W. Kimball performed our sealing. In the few words he spoke, he gave this counsel: \u201cHal and Kathy, live so that when the call comes, you can walk away easily.\u201d\nInitially, we did not understand what that counsel meant for us, but we did our best to live our lives in such a way that we would be prepared to leave to serve the Lord when the call came. After we had been married nearly 10 years, an unanticipated call did come from the Commissioner of Church Education, Neal&nbsp;A. Maxwell.\nThe loving counsel given by President Kimball in the temple to be able to \u201cwalk away easily\u201d became a reality. Kathy and I received a call to leave what seemed an idyllic family situation in California to serve in an assignment and in a place that I knew nothing about. However, our family was ready to leave because a prophet, in a holy temple, a place of revelation, saw a future event for which we were then prepared.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, I bear witness that there is nothing more important than honoring the covenants you have made or may make in the temple. No matter where you are on the covenant path, I urge you to qualify and become eligible to attend the temple. Visit as frequently as circumstances will allow. Make and keep sacred covenants with God. I can assure you of the same truth I shared with Kathy in the middle of the night nearly five decades ago in an Idaho Falls motel room: \u201cNo matter the outcome, all will be well because of temple covenants.\u201d\nI give you my sure witness that Jesus is the Christ. He lives and leads His Church. Temples are houses of the Lord. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson is God\u2019s living prophet on the earth. I love him, and I love each of you. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

I described the purposes of temples in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and responded to their many excellent questions.\nBefore entering the celestial room, I explained that this particular room in the house of the Lord symbolically represents the peace and beauty of the heavenly home to which we can return after this life. I indicated to our guests that we would not speak while in the celestial room, but I would be happy to answer any questions after we moved to the next stop on the tour.\nAfter exiting the celestial room and as we gathered at the next location, I asked our guests if they had any observations they wanted to share. One of the journalists said with great emotion, \u201cI have never experienced anything like that in my entire life. I did not know quiet like that existed in the world; I simply did not believe such stillness was possible.\u201d\nI was struck by both the sincerity and the starkness of this person\u2019s statement. And the journalist\u2019s reaction highlighted one important aspect of stillness\u2014overcoming and tuning out the commotion of our external environment.\nAs I later pondered the journalist\u2019s comment and reflected on the often hectic pace of our modern lives\u2014the busyness, noise, diversions, distractions, and detours that so often seem to demand our attention\u2014a scripture came to my mind: \u201cBe still, and know that I am God.\u201d\nI pray the Holy Ghost will enlighten each of us as we consider a higher and holier dimension of stillness in our lives\u2014an inner spiritual stillness of the soul that enables us to know and remember that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Savior. This remarkable blessing is available to all Church members who are striving faithfully to become \u201ccovenant people of the Lord.\u201d\n\n\nBe Still\n\nIn 1833, the Saints in Missouri were the targets of intense persecution. Mobs had driven them from their homes in Jackson County, and some Church members had tried to establish themselves in other nearby counties. But the persecution continued, and the threats of death were many. In these challenging circumstances, the Lord revealed the following instruction to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Kirtland, Ohio:\n\u201cTherefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; *be still* and know that I am God.\u201d\nI believe the Lord\u2019s admonition to \u201cbe still\u201d entails much more than simply not talking or not moving. Perhaps His intent is for us to remember and rely upon Him and His power \u201cat all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in.\u201d Thus, \u201cbe still\u201d may be a way of reminding us to focus upon the Savior unfailingly as the ultimate source of the spiritual stillness of the soul that strengthens us to do and overcome hard things.\n\n\n\nBuild upon the Rock\n\nTrue faith is always focused in and on the *Lord Jesus Christ*\u2014in Him as the Divine and Only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father and on Him and the redemptive mission He fulfilled.\n\u201cFor he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all those who have faith in him; and they who have faith in him will cleave unto every good thing; wherefore he advocateth the cause of the children of men.\u201d\nJesus Christ is our Redeemer, our Mediator, and our Advocate with the Eternal Father and the rock upon which we should build the spiritual foundation of our lives.\nHelaman explained, \u201cRemember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build *your* foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, *because of the rock upon which ye are built*, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.\u201d\nThe symbolism of Christ as the \u201crock\u201d upon whom we should build the foundation of our lives is most instructive. Please note in this verse that the Savior is not the foundation. Rather, we are admonished to build our personal spiritual foundation upon Him.\nThe foundation is the part of a building that connects it to the ground. A strong foundation provides protection from natural disasters and many other destructive forces. A proper foundation also distributes the weight of a structure over a large area to avoid overloading the underlying soil and provides a level surface for construction.\n\nA strong and reliable connection between the ground and a foundation is essential if a structure is to remain sturdy and stable over time. And for particular types of construction, anchor pins and steel rods can be used to attach the foundation of a building to \u201cbedrock,\u201d the hard, solid rock beneath surface materials such as soil and gravel.\n\nIn a similar way, the foundation of our lives must be connected to the rock of Christ if we are to remain firm and steadfast. The sacred covenants and ordinances of the Savior\u2019s restored gospel can be compared to the anchor pins and steel rods used to connect a building to bedrock. Every time we faithfully receive, review, remember, and renew sacred covenants, our spiritual anchors are secured ever more firmly and steadfastly to the \u201crock\u201d of Jesus Christ.\n\u201cWherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh *an anchor* to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.\u201d\nIncrementally and increasingly \u201cin process of time,\u201d \u201cvirtue [garnishes our] thoughts unceasingly,\u201d our \u201cconfidence [waxes stronger and stronger] in the presence of God,\u201d and \u201cthe Holy Ghost [is our] constant companion.\u201d We become more grounded, rooted, established, and settled. As the foundation of our lives is built upon the Savior, we are blessed to \u201cbe still\u201d\u2014to have a spiritual assurance that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Savior.\n\n\n\nSacred Times, Holy Places, and the Home\n\nThe Lord provides both sacred times and holy places to help us experience and learn about this inner stillness of our souls.\nFor example, the Sabbath is God\u2019s day, a *sacred time* set apart to remember and worship the Father in the name of His Son, to participate in priesthood ordinances, and to receive and renew sacred covenants. Each week we worship the Lord during our home study and also as \u201cfellowcitizens with the saints\u201d during sacrament and other meetings. On His holy day, our thoughts, actions, and demeanor are signs we give to God and an indicator of our love for Him. Every Sunday, if we will, we can be still and know that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Savior.\nA central feature of our Sabbath worship is to \u201cgo to the house of prayer and offer up [our] sacraments upon [the Lord\u2019s] holy day.\u201d The \u201chouse[s] of prayer\u201d in which we gather on the Sabbath are meetinghouses and other approved facilities\u2014*holy places* of reverence, worship, and learning. Each meetinghouse and facility is dedicated by priesthood authority as a place where the Spirit of the Lord may dwell and where God\u2019s children may come \u201cto the knowledge of their Redeemer.\u201d If we will, we can \u201cbe still\u201d in our holy places of worship and know ever more surely that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Savior.\nThe temple is another *holy place* specifically set apart for worshipping and serving God and learning eternal truths. We think, act, and dress differently in the house of the Lord from any other places that we may frequent. In His holy house, if we will, we can be still and know that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Savior.\nThe principal purposes of sacred time and holy places are exactly the same: to repeatedly focus our attention upon Heavenly Father and His plan, the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement, the edifying power of the Holy Ghost, and the promises associated with the sacred ordinances and covenants of the Savior\u2019s restored gospel.\nToday I repeat a principle I previously have emphasized. Our homes should be the ultimate combination of both *sacred time* and *holy place* wherein individuals and families can \u201cbe still\u201d and know that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Savior. Leaving our homes to worship on the Sabbath and in the house of the Lord certainly is essential. But only as we return to our homes with the spiritual perspective and strength obtained in those holy places and activities can we then sustain our focus upon the primary purposes of mortal life and overcome the temptations so prevalent in our fallen world.\nOur ongoing Sabbath, temple, and home experiences should fortify us with the power of the Holy Ghost, with an ongoing and stronger covenant connection to the Father and the Son, and with \u201ca perfect brightness of hope\u201d in God\u2019s eternal promises.\nAs home and Church are gathered together in one in Christ, we may be troubled on every side, but we will not be distressed in our minds and hearts. We may be perplexed by our circumstances and challenges, but we will not be in despair. We may be persecuted, but we will also recognize that we are never alone. We can receive spiritual strength to become and remain firm, steadfast, and true.\n\n\n\nPromise and Testimony\n\nI promise that as we build the foundation of our lives on the \u201crock\u201d of Jesus Christ, we can be blessed by the Holy Ghost to receive an individual and spiritual stillness of the soul that enables us to know and remember that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, Jesus Christ is our Savior, and we can be blessed to do and overcome hard things.\nI joyfully witness that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and the \u201crock\u201d of our salvation. I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.",

As I began my on-the-job training, I spent much of my time preparing witnesses to testify at trial. I quickly learned that facts were determined in a courtroom as witnesses, under oath, testified to the truthfulness of what they had both seen and heard. As witnesses testified, their words were both recorded and preserved. The importance of credible witnesses was always at the forefront of my preparation.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that the very same terms I was using every day as a lawyer were also the terms I used in my gospel conversations. \u201cWitness\u201d and \u201ctestimony\u201d are terms that we use as we share our knowledge and feelings about the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWhen I was sustained as a new Area Seventy, I opened the scriptures to learn my duties and read [[D&C 107|Doctrine and Covenants 107:25]], which states, \u201cThe Seventy are also called \u2026 to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world.\u201d As you can imagine, my eyes were drawn to the term \u201cespecial witnesses.\u201d It became clear to me that I had a responsibility to bear my witness\u2014to testify of the name of Jesus Christ\u2014wherever I traveled in the world.\nThere are many examples in the scriptures of those who were eyewitnesses and who testified to what they both saw and heard.\nAs the ancient prophet Mormon begins his record, he writes, \u201cAnd now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have both seen and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.\u201d\nThe Savior\u2019s Apostles Peter and John healed a man in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. When commanded not to speak in the name of Jesus, they responded:\n\u201cWhether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.\n\u201cFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.\u201d\nAnother compelling testimony comes from the Book of Mormon Saints who witnessed the visit of the Savior Jesus Christ. Listen to this description of their witness: \u201cAnd after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, today I declare my witness and make a record of what I have both seen and heard during my sacred ministry as a Seventy of the Lord Jesus Christ. In doing so, I testify to you of a loving Heavenly Father and His benevolent Son, Jesus Christ, who suffered, died, and rose again to offer eternal life to God\u2019s children. I testify of \u201ca marvelous work and a wonder\u201d and that the Lord has set His hand once again to restore His gospel on the earth through His living prophets and apostles. I testify that based upon what I have both seen and heard, there has never been a better time to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints than today. I know this of my own knowledge, independent of any other source, because of what I have both seen and heard.\nDuring my senior year of high school, to graduate from seminary I had to identify all 15 temples of the Church. A picture of each temple was at the front of our classroom, and I had to know where each was located. Now, years later, it would be an enormous challenge\u2014with 335 operating or announced temples\u2014to identify each one. I have personally seen many of these houses of the Lord and testify that the Lord is offering His blessings and ordinances to more and more of His children across the world.\nMy friends at FamilySearch have taught me that over one million new names are added to FamilySearch each day. If you didn\u2019t find your ancestor yesterday, I invite you to look again tomorrow. When it comes to gathering Israel on the other side of the veil, there has never been a better time to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints than today.\nAs we raised our children in Twin Falls, Idaho, our perspective of the worldwide Church was limited. When I was called to be a General Authority, Marcia and I were assigned to serve in the Pacific Area, a place we had never been. We were pleased to find stakes from the top of New Zealand to the bottom, with a temple that was dedicated in 1958. It was one of those 15 I had to memorize in seminary. We found temples in every major city of Australia, with stakes across that continent. We had assignments in Samoa, where there are 25 stakes, and Tonga, where almost half the population are members of the Church. We had an assignment on the island of Kiribati, where we found two stakes. We had assignments to visit stakes in Ebeye in the Marshall Islands and Daru in Papua New Guinea.\nAfter our service in the Pacific Islands, we were assigned to serve in the Philippines. To my surprise, the Church of Jesus Christ in the Philippines is growing beyond anything I had realized. There are now 125 stakes, 23 missions, and 13 operating or announced temples. I witnessed a church of over 850,000 members in that country. How had I missed the establishment of Christ\u2019s Church across the world?\nAfter three years in the Philippines, I was asked to serve in the Missionary Department. My assignment took us to missions all over the world. My view of the Savior\u2019s worldwide Church expanded exponentially. Marcia and I were assigned to visit missions in Asia. We found a beautiful stake center in Singapore, with amazing, faithful members. We visited members and missionaries in a chapel in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. We met missionaries in Hong Kong and participated in a wonderful stake conference with faithful, devoted Saints.\nThis experience was repeated as we met missionaries and members across Europe, in Latin America, in the Caribbean, and in Africa. The Church of Jesus Christ is experiencing tremendous growth in Africa.\nI am an eyewitness to the ongoing Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the fulfilling of the prophecy of Joseph Smith that \u201cthe truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear.\u201d\nOur wonderful missionaries who now cover the globe are 74,000 strong. Working together with members, they baptize over 20,000 people every month. It has recently been 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old young men and young women who, with the help of the Lord, have produced this mighty miracle of gathering. We find these young women and young men in the small villages of Vanuatu and in the large cities of New York, Paris, and London. I have watched them teach about the Savior in remote congregations in Fiji and larger gatherings in places like Texas, California, and Florida in the United States.\nYou will find missionaries in every corner of the earth speaking 60 different languages and fulfilling the Savior\u2019s great commission in Matthew&nbsp;28: \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d I honor the past and current missionaries of the Church and remind our rising generation of President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson\u2019s invitation to come and gather Israel.\nI testify today that I have observed this profound Restoration of the Savior\u2019s gospel with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears. I am a witness of God\u2019s work across the world. There has never been a better time to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints than today.\nPerhaps the most inspiring miracle of the Restoration that I have witnessed is you, the faithful members of the Church in every land. You, the Latter-day Saints, are described by Nephi in the Book of Mormon as he saw our day and testified, \u201cAnd it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.\u201d\nI testify that I have seen with my own eyes what Nephi saw\u2014you, the covenant Saints in every land, armed with righteousness and the power of God. As I was at the pulpit in one of these great nations of the world, the Lord impressed upon my mind something that King Benjamin taught in [[Mosiah 2|Mosiah&nbsp;2]] in the Book of Mormon. Brent, \u201cI would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual.\u201d\n\nI witness to you that I have seen this with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears as I have met you, faithful Saints of God across the earth who keep the commandments. You are the covenant children of the Father. You are disciples of Jesus Christ. You also know what I know because you have received your personal witness of the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. The Savior taught, \u201cBut blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.\u201d\nUnder the direction of the Lord and the leadership of His prophets and apostles, we will continue to prepare missionaries, make and keep sacred covenants, establish Christ\u2019s Church across the world, and receive the blessings that come as we keep the commandments of God. We are united. We are God\u2019s children. We know Him and we love Him.\nI join all of you, my friends, as we unitedly testify that these things are true. We make a record of what we have both seen and heard. You and I are witnesses who testify. It is with the power of this united witness that we continue to move forward with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel. I declare my witness that Jesus Christ lives. He is our Savior and our Redeemer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "As we journey through mortality, we are at times beset by trials: the severe pain of the loss of loved ones, the arduous fight against illness, the sting of injustice, the harrowing experiences of harassment or abuse, the shadow of unemployment, familial tribulations, the silent cry of loneliness, or the heartrending consequences of armed conflicts. In such moments, our souls yearn for refuge. We seek earnestly to know: Where may we find the balm of peace? In whom can we place our trust to help us with the confidence and strength to surmount these challenges? Who possesses the patience, the encompassing love, and the omnipotent hand to uplift and sustain us?\nThe profound questions of the soul, those that surface in our darkest hours and highest trials, are addressed through the unwavering love of Jesus Christ. In Him, and through the promised blessings of His restored gospel, we find the answers we seek. It is through His infinite Atonement that we are offered a gift beyond measure\u2014one of hope, healing, and the assurance of His constant, enduring presence in our lives. This gift is available to all who reach out with faith, embracing the peace and redemption He so freely offers.\nThe Lord extends His hand to each of us, a gesture that is the very essence of His divine love and kindness. His invitation to us transcends a simple call; it is a divine pledge, reinforced by the enduring power of His grace. In the scriptures, He lovingly assures us:\n\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d\nThe clarity of His invitation \u201ccome unto me\u201d and \u201ctake my yoke\u201d affirms the profound nature of His promise\u2014a promise so vast and complete that it embodies His love, offering us a solemn guarantee: \u201cYe shall find rest.\u201d\nAs we diligently seek spiritual guidance, we embark on a deeply transformative odyssey that strengthens our testimonies. As we comprehend the vastness of our Heavenly Father\u2019s and Jesus Christ\u2019s perfect love, our hearts are filled with gratitude, humility, and a renewed desire to pursue the path of discipleship.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught that \u201cwhen the focus of our lives is on God\u2019s plan of salvation&nbsp;\u2026 and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening\u2014or not happening\u2014in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him.\u201d\nAlma, speaking to his son Helaman, declared: \u201cAnd now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.\u201d\nHelaman, speaking to his sons, taught about this eternal principle of putting the Savior at the center of our lives: \u201cRemember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation.\u201d\nIn [[Matthew 14|Matthew 14]] we learn that after hearing of John the Baptist\u2019s death, Jesus sought solitude. However, a large crowd followed Him. Moved by compassion and love, and not allowing His grief to distract Him from His mission, Jesus welcomed them, healing the sick among them. As evening approached, the disciples faced a daunting challenge: a multitude of people with scant food available. They proposed that Jesus send the crowd away to procure food, but Jesus, with high love and high expectations, asked the disciples to feed them instead.\nWhile the disciples were preoccupied with the immediate challenge, Jesus demonstrated His trust in and love for His Father, coupled with an unwavering love for the people. He directed the crowd to sit on the grass, and taking only five loaves and two fish, He chose to give thanks to His Father, acknowledging God\u2019s provision over His authority and power.\nAfter He gave thanks, Jesus broke the bread, and the disciples distributed it to the people. Miraculously, the food not only sufficed but was abundant, with 12 baskets of leftovers. The group fed included five thousand men, along with women and children.\nThis miracle teaches a profound lesson: when confronted with challenges, it\u2019s easy to become engrossed in our difficulties. However, Jesus Christ exemplified the power of focusing on His Father, offering gratitude, and acknowledging that solutions to our trials do not always lie within ourselves but with God.\nWhen we encounter difficulties, we naturally tend to concentrate on the obstacles we face. Our challenges are tangible and command our attention, yet the principle of surmounting them is in our focus. By placing Christ at the core of our thoughts and deeds, we align ourselves with His outlook and strength. This adjustment does not discount our struggles; instead, it helps us to navigate through them under divine guidance. As a result, we discover solutions and support that arise from a higher wisdom. Adopting this Christ-centric perspective empowers us with the fortitude and insight to turn our trials into victories, reminding us that with the Savior, what seems like a major problem can become a pathway to greater spiritual progress.\nThe story of Alma the Younger in the Book of Mormon presents a compelling narrative of redemption and the profound impact of centering one\u2019s life around Christ. At first, Alma stood as an opponent of the Lord\u2019s Church, leading many astray from the path of righteousness. However, a divine intervention, marked by an angelic visitation, awakened him from his wrongdoings.\nIn his darkest hour, tormented by guilt and desperate to find a way out of his spiritual anguish, Alma remembered his father\u2019s teachings about Jesus Christ and the power of His Atonement. With a heart yearning for redemption, he earnestly repented and pleaded fervently for the Lord\u2019s mercy. This crucial moment of complete surrender, bringing Christ to the forefront of his thoughts as Alma earnestly sought His mercy, triggered a remarkable transformation. The heavy chains of guilt and despair vanished and were replaced by an overwhelming sense of joy and peace.\nJesus Christ is our hope and the answer to life\u2019s greatest pains. Through His sacrifice, He paid for our sins and took upon Himself all of our suffering\u2014pain, injustice, sorrow, and fear\u2014and He forgives and heals us when we trust in Him and seek to change our lives for the better. He is our Healer, comforting and repairing our hearts through His love and power, just like He healed many during His time on earth. He is the living water, fulfilling the deepest needs of our souls with His constant love and kindness. This is like the promise He made to the Samaritan woman at the well, offering \u201ca well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d\nI bear solemn witness that Jesus Christ lives, that He presides over this, His sacred Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I testify that He is the Savior of the world, the Prince of Peace, the King of kings, the Lord of lords, the Redeemer of the world. I affirm with certainty that we are ever present in His mind and heart. As a testament to this, He has restored His Church in these latter days and has called President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson as His prophet and the President of the Church at this time. I know that Jesus Christ gave His life so that we might have eternal life.\nAs we strive to place Him at the center of our lives, revelations unfold to us, His profound peace envelops us, and His infinite Atonement brings about our forgiveness and healing. It is in Him that we discover the strength to overcome, the courage to persevere, and the peace that surpasses all understanding. May we strive each day to draw nearer to Him, the source of all that is good, the beacon of hope in our journey back to the presence of our Heavenly Father. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

At first, Alma stood as an opponent of the Lord\u2019s Church, leading many astray from the path of righteousness. However, a divine intervention, marked by an angelic visitation, awakened him from his wrongdoings."

With a heart yearning for redemption, he earnestly repented and pleaded fervently for the Lord\u2019s mercy. This crucial moment of complete surrender, bringing Christ to the forefront of his thoughts as Alma earnestly sought His mercy, triggered a remarkable transformation. The heavy chains of guilt and despair vanished and were replaced by an overwhelming sense of joy and peace."

Yet, in this world of tribulation, \u201cwe know that all things work together for good to them that love God.\u201d Indeed, as we walk uprightly and remember our covenants, \u201call things shall work together for your good.\u201d\nAll things for our good.\nA remarkable promise! Comforting assurance from God Himself! In a miraculous way, the purpose of Creation and the nature of God are to know beginning and end, to bring about all that is for our good, and to help us become sanctified and holy through Jesus Christ\u2019s grace and Atonement.\nJesus Christ\u2019s Atonement can deliver and redeem us from sin. But Jesus Christ also intimately understands our every pain, affliction, sickness, sorrow, separation. In time and eternity, His triumph over death and hell can make all things right. He helps heal the broken and disparaged, reconcile the angry and divided, comfort the lonely and isolated, encourage the uncertain and imperfect, and bring forth miracles possible only with God.\nWe sing hallelujah and shout hosanna! With eternal power and infinite goodness, in God\u2019s plan of happiness all things can work together for our good. We can face life with confidence and not fear.\nLeft on our own, we may not know our own good. When \u201cI choose me,\u201d I am also choosing my own limitations, weaknesses, inadequacies. Ultimately, to do the most good, we must be good. Since none save God is good, we seek perfection in Jesus Christ. We become our truest, best selves only as we put off the natural man or woman and become a child before God.\nWith our trust and faith in God, trials and afflictions can be consecrated for our good. Joseph, sold into slavery in Egypt, later saved his family and people. The Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s incarceration in Liberty Jail taught him \u201cthese things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.\u201d Lived with faith, trials and sacrifices we would never choose can bless us and others in ways never imagined.\nWe increase faith and trust in the Lord that all things can work together for our good as we gain eternal perspective; understand our trials may be \u201cbut for a small moment\u201d; recognize affliction can be consecrated for our gain; acknowledge accidents, untimely death, debilitating illness, and disease are part of mortality; and trust loving Heavenly Father does not give trials to punish or judge. He would not give a stone to someone asking for bread nor a serpent to one asking for a fish.\nWhen trials come, often what we most want is for someone to listen and be with us. In the moment, clich\u00e9 answers can be unhelpful, however comforting their intent. Sometimes we yearn for someone who will grieve, ache, and weep with us; let us express pain, frustration, sometimes even anger; and acknowledge with us there are things we do not know.\nWhen we trust God and His love for us, even our greatest heartbreaks can, in the end, work together for our good.\nI remember the day I received word of a serious car accident which involved those I love. At such times, in anguish and faith, we can only say with Job, \u201cThe Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\u201d\nAcross the worldwide Church, some 3,500 stakes and districts and some 30,000 wards and branches provide refuge and safety. But within our stakes and wards, many faithful families and individuals confront difficult challenges, even while knowing that (without yet knowing how) things will work together for our good.\nIn Huddersfield, England, Brother Samuel Bridgstock was diagnosed with stage-four cancer shortly before the calling of a new stake president. Given his dire diagnosis, he asked his wife, Anna, why he would even go to be interviewed.\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Sister Bridgstock said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be called as stake president.\u201d\n\nInitially given a year or two to live, President Bridgstock (who is here today) is now in his fourth year of service. He has good and hard days. His stake is rallying with increased faith, service, and kindness. It is not easy, but his wife and family live with faith, gratitude, and understandable sadness they trust will become eternal joy through Jesus Christ\u2019s restoring Atonement.\nWhen we are still, open, and reverent, we may feel the beauty, purpose, and serenity of the covenant belonging the Lord offers. In sacred moments, He may let us glimpse the larger eternal reality of which our daily lives are part, where small and simple things work together for the good of givers and receivers.\nRebekah, the daughter of my first mission president, shared how the Lord answered her prayer for comfort with an unexpected opportunity to answer someone else\u2019s prayer.\n\nLate one evening, Rebekah, grieving her mother\u2019s recent passing, had a clear impression to go buy gas for her car. When she arrived at the station, she met an elderly woman struggling to breathe with a large oxygen tank. Later, Rebekah was able to give the woman her mother\u2019s portable oxygen machine. This sister gratefully said, \u201cYou\u2019ve given me back my freedom.\u201d Things work together for good when we minister as Jesus Christ would.\nA father assigned with his teacher-age son as ministering companions explained, \u201cMinistering is when we go from being neighbors who bring cookies to trusted friends, spiritual first responders.\u201d Covenant belonging in Jesus Christ comforts, connects, consecrates.\nEven in tragedy, spiritual preparation may remind us Heavenly Father knew when we felt most vulnerable and alone. For example, a family whose child was taken to the hospital later found comfort in remembering the Holy Ghost had whispered in advance what to expect.\nSometimes the larger eternal reality the Lord lets us feel includes family across the veil. A sister found joy in conversion to Jesus Christ\u2019s restored gospel. Yet two traumas had deeply impacted her life\u2014seeing a boating accident and tragically losing her mother, who had taken her own life.\n\nYet this sister overcame her fear of water enough to be baptized by immersion. And on what became a very happy day, she witnessed someone, acting as proxy for her deceased mother, be baptized in the temple. \u201cTemple baptism healed my mother, and it freed me,\u201d the sister said. \u201cIt was the first time I felt peace since my mother died.\u201d\nOur sacred music echoes His assurance that all things can work together for our good.\n\n\nBe still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake\nTo guide the future as he has the past.\nThy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;\nAll now mysterious shall be bright at last.\n\n\n\n\nCome, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;\nBut with joy wend your way.\nThough hard to you this journey may appear,\nGrace shall be as your day.&nbsp;\u2026\nAnd should we die before our journey\u2019s through,\nHappy day! All is well!\n\n\nThe Book of Mormon is evidence we can hold in our hand that Jesus is the Christ and God fulfills His prophecies. Written by inspired prophets who saw our day, the Book of Mormon begins with raw drama\u2014a family dealing with deep differences. Yet, as we study and ponder 1&nbsp;Nephi&nbsp;1 through to Moroni&nbsp;10, we are drawn to Jesus Christ with a firm testimony that what happened there and then can bless us here and now.\nAs the Lord, through His living prophet, brings more houses of the Lord closer in more places, temple blessings work together for our good. We come by covenant and ordinance to God our Father and Jesus Christ and gain eternal perspective on mortality. One by one, name by name, we offer beloved family members\u2014ancestors\u2014sacred ordinances and covenant blessings in the Lord\u2019s pattern of saviors on Mount Zion.\nAs temples come closer to us in many places, a temple sacrifice we can offer is to seek holiness in the house of the Lord more frequently. For many years, we have saved, planned, and sacrificed to come to the temple. Now, as circumstances permit, please come even more often to the Lord in His holy house. Let regular temple worship and service bless, protect, and inspire you and your family\u2014the family you have or the family you will have and become someday.\n\nAlso, where your circumstances permit, please consider the blessing of owning your own temple clothes. A grandmother from a humble family said of anything in the world, what she most wanted were her own temple clothes. Her grandson said, \u201cGrandma whispered, \u2018I will serve in my own temple clothes, and after I die, I will be buried in them.\u2019\u201d And when the time came, she was.\nAs President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson teaches, \u201c*Everything* we believe and *every* promise God has made to His covenant people come together in the temple.\u201d\nIn time and eternity, the purpose of Creation and the nature of God Himself are to bring all things together for our good.\nThis is the Lord\u2019s eternal purpose. It is His eternal perspective. It is His eternal promise.\nWhen life is cluttered and purpose isn\u2019t clear, when you want to live better but don\u2019t know how, please come to God our Father and Jesus Christ. Trust They live, love you, and want all things for your good. I testify They do, infinitely and eternally, in the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

I have felt the power of Book of Mormon prophets teaching parents, bishops, and ward members through studying this account.\nHelaman was a man that the young Ammonites could trust. He helped them develop and mature in righteousness. They knew and loved him and \u201cwould that [he] should be their leader.\u201d\nHelaman loved these young men like sons and saw their potential. Elder Dale&nbsp;G. Renlund taught that \u201cto effectively serve others we must see them \u2026 through Heavenly Father\u2019s eyes. Only then can we begin to comprehend the true worth of a soul. Only then can we sense the love that Heavenly Father has for all \u2026 His children.\u201d Bishops today are blessed with discernment to see the divine identity of the youth in their care.\nHelaman \u201cnumbered\u201d the young men in his care. He prioritized building strong relationships with them.\nAt a critical time when life and death hung in the balance, Helaman and his young warriors lost track of the army pursuing them. Helaman counseled with the youth:\n\u201cBehold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cTherefore what say ye, my sons&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;?\u201d\nThese faithful young men responded, \u201cFather, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth.\u201d The day was won, as Helaman supported these young men in their resolve to act.\nThe young Ammonites had a great cause and were valiant in \u201cthe support of the people.\u201d \u201cThis little force,\u201d led by Helaman, spread \u201cgreat hopes and much joy\u201d into the hearts of the experienced Nephite armies. Bishops today can lead their uniquely gifted youth in blessing the ward and gathering Israel. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught that this is the mission \u201cfor which [they] were sent to earth.\u201d\nLike these young Ammonites who were \u201ctrue at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted,\u201d Helaman faithfully followed his leaders. No matter the challenge or setback, Helaman always remained \u201cfixed with a determination\u201d to advance their purpose. When he was directed to \u201cmarch forth with [his] little sons,\u201d he obeyed.\n\nThe youth today are blessed as bishops follow the guidance of our leaders to \u201ccounsel with the ward Young Women president[s].\u201d Stake presidents ensure that bishops and Young Women presidents are instructed in fulfilling their responsibilities for the youth.\nHelaman honored covenants. When Ammon taught the gospel to the parents of the stripling young men, these parents embraced it with open hearts. They were so committed to their new life of righteous discipleship that they made a covenant to \u201clay down the weapons of their rebellion.\u201d The only thing that caused them to consider breaking this covenant, going back to their familiar past of fighting, was seeing the Nephites in danger.\nThe Ammonites wanted to help these people who had offered them a safe home. Helaman, along with others, persuaded them to keep their covenant never to fight. He trusted more in the strength that God would provide than in the strength these Ammonites could have provided with their swords and arrows.\nWhen Helaman and his young warriors faced daunting challenges, Helaman was resolute. \u201cBehold, it mattereth not\u2014we trust God will deliver us.\u201d In one instance, when they were on the verge of starving to death, their response was to \u201cpour out [their] souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen [them] and deliver [them]; \u2026 [and] the Lord \u2026 did visit [them] with assurances that he would deliver [them]\u201d \u201cbecause of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe.\u201d\nWe learn from Helaman that these young men were supported by their parents. These faithful parents knew they had the primary responsibility for teaching their children. They taught their children to keep the commandments and \u201cwalk uprightly\u201d before God. Their mothers taught them \u201cthat if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.\u201d Their fathers set a powerful example of covenant making. These former warriors knew the horrors of battle. They entrusted their inexperienced sons to Helaman\u2019s care and supported them by sending \u201cmany provisions.\u201d\nHelaman wasn\u2019t alone as he served his young army. He had people around him whom he turned to for support and guidance. He reached out to Captain Moroni for help, and it came.\nNo one serving in the Lord\u2019s kingdom serves alone. The Lord has blessed us with wards and stakes. Through His restored organization, we have the resources, wisdom, and inspiration to meet any challenge.\nA bishop provides guidance for the ward through councils. He promotes quarterly ministering interviews and then encourages the elders quorum and Relief Society to fulfill their responsibility of ministering to families. These presidencies take the lead in assessing needs and finding inspired solutions. Stake presidents offer support by instructing the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies in these responsibilities.\nThe needed guidance for leaders and parents is found in the Gospel Library and the Gospel Living apps. In these inspired resources, we can find the scriptures, teachings of modern prophets, and the General Handbook. The Youth tab in the Gospel Library has many resources for quorum and class presidencies and has For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices. As all members of the ward study these inspired sources and seek guidance from the Spirit, everyone will be directed by the Lord in strengthening the youth.\nThe entire ward will be blessed and strengthened as members focus on the rising generation. Despite our imperfections and shortcomings, Heavenly Father invites each of us, through the companionship of His Spirit, to reach out to others. He knows that we grow and are sanctified as we follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost. It doesn\u2019t matter that our efforts are imperfect. When we partner with the Lord, we can trust that our efforts will be in line with what He would do for the youth.\nBy following the direction of the Holy Ghost in reaching out to the youth, we become witnesses of Heavenly Father\u2019s love in their lives. Acting on promptings from the Lord builds relationships of love and trust. It is relationships in the lives of the youth that have the greatest influence on their choices.\nThe youth will learn the pattern of revelation as they participate with us in the process of seeking and acting upon promptings to serve others. As the youth turn to the Lord for this inspired guidance, their relationships with and trust in Him will deepen.\nWe express our confidence in the youth by offering support and direction without taking over. As we step back and allow the youth to learn through counseling together, choosing an inspired course, and putting their plan into action, they will experience true joy and growth.\nPresident Henry&nbsp;B. Eyring taught that \u201cwhat will matter most is what they learn from [you] about who they really are and what they can really become. My guess is that they won\u2019t learn it so much from lectures. They will get it from feelings of who you are, who you think they are, and what you think they might become.\u201d\nOur youth amaze us with their courage, their faith, and their abilities. As they choose to be fully engaged disciples of Jesus Christ, His gospel will be etched upon their hearts. Following Him will become a part of who they are, not just what they do.\nHelaman helped the young Ammonites to see how a valiant disciple of Jesus Christ lives. We can be powerful examples to the youth of how disciples of Christ live today. Faithful parents are praying for these examples in the lives of their children. No program can replace the influence of loving, covenant-keeping adults.\nAs the president of the priests quorum, the bishop can set an example for the youth of how to be a loyal husband and a loving father through protecting, providing, and presiding in righteous ways. Bishops, with a \u201claser-like focus on [the] youth,\u201d will have an influence that will last for generations.\nThe youth today are among Heavenly Father\u2019s most noble spirits. They were among the stalwart defenders of truth and agency in the premortal world. They were born in these days to gather Israel through their powerful witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. He knows each one of them and knows their great potential. He is patient as they grow. He will redeem and protect them. He will heal and guide them. He will inspire them. We, their parents and leaders, have been prepared to support them. We have the Savior\u2019s Church to assist us as we raise the next generation.\nI bear witness that Christ\u2019s Church, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith and led today by President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, is organized to help the youth fulfill their great purpose in these latter days. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "I have felt deeply about the Atonement of Jesus Christ since I was quite young, but the reality of the Savior\u2019s Atonement came home to me when I was 25. I had just graduated from Stanford Law School and was studying for the California bar exam. My mother called and said that my grandfather Crozier Kimball, who lived in Utah, was dying. She said if I wanted to see him, I had better come home. My grandfather was 86 and very ill. I had a wonderful visit. He was so pleased to see me and share his testimony with me.\nWhen Crozier was just three years old, his father, David Patten Kimball, died at age 44. Crozier hoped that his father and his grandfather Heber&nbsp;C. Kimball would approve of his life and feel he had been true to his heritage.\nMy grandfather\u2019s primary counsel to me was to avoid any sense of entitlement or privilege because of these faithful ancestors. He told me my focus should be on the Savior and the Savior\u2019s Atonement. He said we are all children of a loving Heavenly Father. Regardless of who our earthly ancestors are, each of us will report to the Savior on how well we kept His commandments.\nGrandpa referred to the Savior as the \u201cKeeper of the Gate,\u201d a reference to [[2 Nephi 9|2&nbsp;Nephi 9:41]]. He told me he hoped he had been sufficiently repentant to qualify for the Savior\u2019s mercy.\nI was deeply touched. I knew he had been a righteous man. He was a patriarch and served several missions. He taught me that no one can return to God by good works alone without the benefit of the Savior\u2019s Atonement. I can remember to this day the great love and appreciation Grandpa had for the Savior and His Atonement.\nIn 2019 during an assignment in Jerusalem, I visited an upper room which may have been near the site where the Savior washed His Apostles\u2019 feet prior to His Crucifixion. I was spiritually touched and thought of how He commanded His Apostles to love one another.\nI recalled the Savior\u2019s pleading Intercessory Prayer in our behalf. This prayer occurred in literally the closing hours of His mortal life as recorded in the Gospel of John.\nThis prayer was directed to followers of Christ, including all of us. In the Savior\u2019s petition to His Father, He pleaded \u201cthat they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.\u201d The Savior then continues, \u201cAnd the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.\u201d *Oneness* is what Christ prayed for prior to His betrayal and Crucifixion. Oneness with Christ and our Heavenly Father can be obtained through the Savior\u2019s Atonement.\nThe Lord\u2019s saving mercy is not dependent on lineage, education, economic status, or race. It is based on being one with Christ and His commandments.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the revelation on Church organization and government in 1830, soon after the Church was organized. What is now [[D&C 20|section 20]] was read by the Prophet Joseph at the first Church conference and was the first revelation approved by common consent.\nThe content of this revelation is truly remarkable. It teaches us the significance and role of the Savior and how to access His power and blessings through His atoning grace. The Prophet Joseph was 24 years old and had already received numerous revelations and completed the translation of the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God. Both Joseph and Oliver are identified as ordained Apostles, thus having authority to preside over the Church.\n[[D&C 20|Verses 17 through 36]] contain a summary of essential Church doctrine, including the reality of God, the Creation of mankind, the Fall, and Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of salvation through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. [[D&C 20|Verse 37]] contains the essential requirements for baptism into the Lord\u2019s Church. [[D&C 20|Verses 75 through 79]] set forth the sacrament prayers we utilize every Sabbath.\nThe doctrine, principles, sacraments, and practices that the Lord established through Joseph Smith, the Prophet of the Restoration, are truly seminal.\nThe requirements for baptism, while profound, are uniquely simple. They primarily include humility before God, a broken heart and contrite spirit, repenting of all sins, taking upon us the name of Jesus Christ, enduring to the end, and showing by our works that we have received of the Spirit of Christ.\nIt is significant that all the qualifications for baptism are spiritual. No economic or social attainment is necessary. The poor and the rich have the same spiritual requirements.\nThere are no race, gender, or ethnicity requirements. The Book of Mormon makes it clear that *all* are invited to partake of the Lord\u2019s goodness, \u201cblack and white, bond and free, male and female; \u2026 all are alike unto God.\u201d \u201cAll men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.\u201d\nGiven our \u201clikeness\u201d before God, it makes little sense to emphasize our differences. Some have wrongly encouraged us \u201cto imagine people to be much more different from ourselves and from each other than they actually are. [Some] take real but small differences and magnify them into chasms.\u201d\nIn addition, some have wrongly assumed that because all people are invited to receive His goodness and eternal life, there are no conduct requirements.\nHowever, the scriptures attest that all accountable persons are required to repent of sins and keep His commandments. The Lord makes it clear that all have moral agency and \u201care free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, \u2026 and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life.\u201d To receive the blessings of the Savior\u2019s Atonement, we must affirmatively exercise our moral agency to choose Christ and obey His commandments.\nDuring my life, the meaning of \u201cagency\u201d and \u201cfree will\u201d has been dissected and debated. There have been and continue to be many intellectual arguments on these topics.\nOn the recent cover of a major university alumni publication, a prominent biologist-professor asserts, \u201cThere\u2019s no room for free will.\u201d Not surprisingly, the professor is quoted in the article as saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as God, \u2026 and there\u2019s no free will, \u2026 and this is a vast, indifferent, empty universe.\u201d I could not disagree more strongly.\nA fundamental doctrine of our faith is that we do have moral agency, which includes free will. Agency is the ability to choose and act. It is essential to the plan of salvation. Without moral agency, we could not learn, progress, or choose to be one with Christ. Because of moral agency, we \u201care free to choose liberty and eternal life.\u201d In the premortal Council in Heaven, the Father\u2019s plan included agency as an essential element. Lucifer rebelled and \u201csought to destroy the agency of man.\u201d Accordingly, the privilege of having a mortal body was denied to Satan and those who followed him.\nOther premortal spirits exercised their agency in following Heavenly Father\u2019s plan. Spirits blessed by birth to this mortal life continue to have agency. We are free to choose and act, but we do not control the consequences. \u201cChoices of good and righteousness lead to happiness, peace, and eternal life, while choices of sin and evil eventually lead to heartache and misery.\u201d As Alma said, \u201cWickedness never was happiness.\u201d\nIn this extremely competitive world, there is a constant effort to excel. Striving to be the best we can be is a righteous and worthwhile endeavor. It is consistent with the Lord\u2019s doctrine. Efforts to diminish or deprecate others or create barriers to their success are contrary to the Lord\u2019s doctrine. We cannot blame circumstances or others for a decision to act contrary to God\u2019s commandments.\nIn today\u2019s world, it is easy to focus on material and occupational success. Some lose sight of eternal principles and choices that have eternal significance. We would be wise to follow President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson\u2019s counsel to \u201cthink celestial.\u201d\nThe most significant choices can be made by almost everyone regardless of talents, abilities, opportunities, or economic circumstances. An emphasis on putting family choices first is essential. This is clear throughout the scriptures. Think of the account in 1&nbsp;Nephi where Lehi \u201cdeparted into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family.\u201d\nAs we face the vicissitudes of life, many events occur over which we have little or no control. Health challenges and accidents obviously can fit into this category. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted people who did everything right. For the most important choices, we do have control. Going back to my missionary days, Elder Marion&nbsp;D. Hanks, our mission president, had all of us memorize part of a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox:\n\n\nThere is no chance, no destiny, no fate,\nCan circumvent or hinder or control\nThe firm resolve of a determined soul.\n\n\nOn matters of principle, conduct, religious observance, and righteous living, we are in control. Our faith in and worship of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, is a choice that we make.\nPlease understand I am not advocating less interest in education or occupation. What I am saying is that when efforts relating to education and occupation are elevated above the family or being one with Christ, the unintended consequences can be significantly adverse.\nThe clear and simple doctrine set forth in [[D&C 20|Doctrine and Covenants 20]] is touching and compelling as it amplifies and clarifies sacred spiritual concepts. It teaches that salvation comes as Jesus Christ justifies and sanctifies repentant souls because of the Savior\u2019s grace. It sets the stage for the preeminent role of His Atonement.\nWe should strive to include others in our circle of oneness. If we are to follow President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson\u2019s admonition to gather scattered Israel on both sides of the veil, we need to include others in our circle of oneness. As President Nelson has so beautifully taught: \u201cOn every continent and across the isles of the sea, faithful people are being gathered into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Differences in culture, language, gender, race, and nationality fade into insignificance as the faithful enter the covenant path and come unto our beloved Redeemer.\u201d\nWe are united by our love of and faith in Jesus Christ and as children of a loving Heavenly Father. The essence of truly belonging is to be one with Christ. The ordinances of baptism and the sacrament set forth in [[D&C 20|Doctrine and Covenants 20]], together with our temple covenants, unite us in special ways and allow us to be one in every eternally significant way and to live in peace and harmony.\nI bear my sure and certain witness that Jesus Christ lives, and because of His Atonement, we can be one with Christ. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

I testify that miracles have not ceased, angels are among us, and the heavens are truly open.\nWhen our Savior, Jesus Christ, was on the earth, He gave priesthood keys to His chief Apostle, Peter. Through these keys, Peter and the other Apostles led the Savior\u2019s Church. But when those Apostles died, the keys of the priesthood were taken from the earth.\nI testify that the ancient keys of the priesthood have been restored. Peter, James, and John and other ancient prophets appeared as resurrected beings, bestowing upon the Prophet Joseph Smith what the Lord described as \u201cthe keys of my kingdom, and a dispensation of the gospel.\u201d\nThose same keys have been passed from prophet to prophet until today. The 15 men we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators use them to lead the Savior\u2019s Church. As in ancient times, there is one senior Apostle who holds and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys. He is President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, prophet and President of the restored Church of Christ in our day: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThrough the Savior\u2019s Church, we receive the blessings of the priesthood\u2014including the power of God to help us in our lives. Under authorized priesthood keys, we make sacred promises to God and receive sacred ordinances that prepare us to live in His presence. Beginning with baptism and confirmation and then in the temple, we move forward on a path of covenants that leads us back to Him.\nWith hands laid on our heads, we also receive priesthood blessings, including direction, comfort, counsel, healing, and the power to follow Jesus Christ. Throughout my life I have been blessed by this great power. As it has been revealed in scripture, we refer to it as the power of the holy Melchizedek Priesthood.\nIn my youth I gained a great respect for this power, especially as it was manifest in priesthood blessings. While serving as a young missionary in Chile, my companion and I were arrested and separated. We were never told why. It was a time of great political upheaval. Thousands of people were taken into custody by the military police and never heard from again.\nAfter being interrogated, I sat alone in a jail cell, not knowing if I would ever see my loved ones again. I turned to my Heavenly Father, fervently pleading: \u201cFather, I have always been taught that Thou watcheth over Thy missionaries. Please, Father, I am nothing special, but I have been obedient and I need Thy help tonight.\u201d\nThe seeds of this help had been planted many years earlier. After my baptism, I was confirmed a member of the Church and given the gift of the Holy Ghost. As I prayed, alone, behind bars, the Holy Ghost immediately came to me and comforted me. He brought to my mind a very special passage from my patriarchal blessing, which is another blessing of the priesthood. In it, God promised me that through my faithfulness I would be able to be sealed in the temple for time and eternity to a woman full of beauty and virtue and love, that we would become the parents of precious sons and daughters, and that I would be blessed and magnified as a father in Israel.\nThose inspired words about my future filled my soul with peace. I knew that they had come from my loving Heavenly Father, who always keeps His promises. In that moment, I had the assurance that I would be released and live to see those promises fulfilled.\nAbout a year later, Heavenly Father did bless me with a wife who is full of beauty and virtue and love. Lynette and I were sealed in the temple. We were blessed with three precious sons and four precious daughters. I became a father, all according to God\u2019s promises in the patriarchal blessing I received as a 17-year-old boy.\n\u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren [and sisters], have miracles ceased because Christ hath ascended into heaven?&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.\u201d\nI testify that miracles and ministrations are continually occurring in our lives, often as a direct result of priesthood power. Some priesthood blessings are fulfilled immediately, in ways we can see and understand. Others are unfolding gradually and will not be fully realized in this life. But God keeps all of His promises, always, as illustrated in this account from our family history:\nMy paternal grandfather, Grant Reese Bowen, was a man of great faith. I vividly remember hearing him recount how he received his own patriarchal blessing. In his journal, he recorded: \u201cThe patriarch promised me the gift of healing. He said, \u2018The sick shall be healed. Yea, *the dead shall be raised under your hands*.\u2019\u201d\nYears later, Grandfather was piling hay when he felt prompted to return to the house. He was met by his father coming toward him. \u201cGrant, your mother has just passed away,\u201d his father said.\nI quote again from Grandfather\u2019s journal: \u201cI didn\u2019t stop but went hurrying into the house and out on the front porch where she lay on a cot. I looked at her and could see there was no sign of life left in her. I remembered my patriarchal blessing and the promise that if I were faithful, through my faith the sick would be healed; and the dead would be raised. I placed my hands on her head, and I told the Lord that if the promise that He had made to me by the patriarch was true, to make it manifest at this time and raise my mother back to life. I promised Him if He would do this, I should never hesitate to do all in my power for the building up of His kingdom. As I prayed, she opened her eyes and said, \u2018Grant, raise me up. I have been in the spirit world, but you have called me back. Let this always be a testimony to you and to the rest of my family.\u2019\u201d\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught us to seek and expect miracles. I testify that because the priesthood has been restored, the power and authority of God are upon the earth. Through callings and councils, men and women, young and old, can participate in priesthood work. It is a work of miracles, attended by angels. It is the work of heaven, and it blesses all God\u2019s children.\nIn 1989, our family of seven was returning from a ward outing. It was late. Lynette was expecting our sixth child. She felt a strong prompting to fasten her seat belt, which she had forgotten to do. Shortly thereafter we came around a bend in the road; a car crossed the line into our lane. Going about 70 miles (112 km) an hour, I swerved to avoid hitting the oncoming car. Our van rolled, skidded down the highway, and slid off the road, finally coming to a stop, landing with the passenger side in the dirt.\nThe next thing I remember hearing was Lynette\u2019s voice: \u201cShayne, we need to get out through your door.\u201d I was hanging in the air by my seat belt. It took a few seconds to get oriented. We started lifting each of the children out of the van through my window, which was now the ceiling of the van. They were crying, wondering what had happened.\nWe soon realized that our 10-year-old daughter, Emily, was missing. We yelled her name, but there was no response. Ward members, who were also traveling home, were at the scene frantically looking for her. It was so dark. I looked in the van again with a flashlight and, to my horror, saw Emily\u2019s tiny body trapped under the van. I called out desperately, \u201cWe have to lift the van off of Emily.\u201d I grabbed the roof and pulled back. There were only a few others lifting, but the van miraculously flipped onto its wheels, exposing Emily\u2019s lifeless body.\nEmily was not breathing. Her face was the color of a purple plum. I said, \u201cWe need to give her a blessing.\u201d A dear friend and ward member knelt with me, and by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood, in the name of Jesus Christ, we commanded her to live. In that moment, Emily took a long raspy breath.\nAfter what seemed like hours, the ambulance finally arrived. Emily was rushed to the hospital. She had a collapsed lung and a severed tendon in her knee. Brain damage was a concern because of the time she was without oxygen. Emily was in a coma for a day and a half. We continued to pray and fast for her. She was blessed with a full recovery. Today, Emily and her husband, Kevin, are the parents of six daughters.\nMiraculously, everyone else was able to walk away. The baby Lynette was carrying was Tyson. He too was spared any harm and was born the next February. Eight months later, after receiving his earthly body, Tyson returned home to Heavenly Father. He is our guardian angel son. We feel his influence in our family and look forward to being with him again.\nThose who lifted the van off of Emily observed that the van seemed to weigh nothing. I knew that heavenly angels had joined with earthly angels to lift the vehicle off of Emily\u2019s body. I also know that Emily was brought back to life by the power of the holy priesthood.\n\nThe Lord revealed this truth to His servants: \u201cI will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.\u201d\nI testify that \u201cthe Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God\u201d\u2014the Melchizedek Priesthood\u2014with its keys, authority, and power has been restored to the earth in these latter days. I know that while not all circumstances turn out like we may hope and pray for, God\u2019s miracles will always come according to His will, His timing, and His plan for us.\nIf you desire the blessings of the priesthood, including miracles and the ministry of angels, I invite you to walk the path of covenants God has made available to each of us. Members and leaders of the Church who love you will help you take the next step.\nI testify that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, lives and leads His Church through living prophets who hold and exercise priesthood keys. The Holy Ghost is real. The Savior gave His life to heal us, reclaim us, and bring us home.\nI witness that miracles have not ceased, angels are among us, and the heavens are open. And oh, how open they are! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "This evening, I speak to the youth of the Church, the rising generation of young men and young women who are the standard bearers for the next generation.\nIn October 2013, our beloved prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, declared: \u201cYour Heavenly Father has known you for a very long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth.\u201d\nTwo years ago, President Nelson continued:\n\u201cToday I reaffirm strongly that the Lord has asked *every* worthy, able young man to prepare for and serve a mission. For Latter-day Saint young men, missionary service is a priesthood responsibility. You young men have been reserved for this time when the promised gathering of Israel is taking place. \u2026\n\u201cFor you young and able sisters, a mission is also a powerful, but *optional*, opportunity. \u2026 Pray to know if the Lord would have you serve a mission, and the Holy Ghost will respond to your heart and mind.\u201d\nOur prophet\u2019s references to the Lord holding the youth of our day in reserve for this time in the gathering of Israel and his invitation to pray to know what the Lord would have you do are, in part, references to the life you lived and blessings you received from God before you were born on this earth. All of us who are born on this earth first lived with our Heavenly Father as His spirit children. The Lord declared to Moses, \u201cI, the Lord God, created all things \u2026 spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth.\u201d\nWhen He created you spiritually, He loved you as His spirit sons and daughters and embedded within each of you a divine nature and eternal destiny.\nDuring your premortal life, you \u201cdeveloped [your] identity and increased [your] spiritual capabilities.\u201d You were blessed with the gift of agency, the ability to make choices for yourself, and you did make important decisions, such as the decision to follow Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of happiness, which is to \u201cobtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress \u2026 and ultimately realize [your] divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.\u201d This decision affected your life then, in your premortal life, and it continues to affect your life now. As a child of God living in your premortal life, you \u201cgrew in intelligence and learned to love the truth.\u201d\nBefore you were born, God appointed each of you to fulfill specific missions during your mortal life upon the earth. If you remain worthy, the blessings of that premortal decree will enable you to have all kinds of opportunities in this life, including opportunities to serve in the Church and to participate in the most important work happening on the earth today: the gathering of Israel. Those premortal promises and blessings are called your foreordination. \u201cThe doctrine of foreordination applies to all members of the Church.\u201d Foreordination does not guarantee that you will receive certain callings or responsibilities. These blessings and opportunities come in this life as a result of your righteous exercise of agency, just as your foreordination in your premortal life came as a result of righteousness. As you prove yourself worthy and progress along the covenant path, you will receive opportunities to serve in your Young Women class or priesthood quorum. You will be blessed to serve in the temple, to become a ministering brother or sister, and to serve a mission as a disciple of Jesus Christ.\nWhy does it matter to seek to know and understand your foreordination? In a day when questions abound, when so many seek to know their true identity, the fact that God knows and has blessed each one of us individually before we were ever born on this earth with \u201cessential characteristic[s] of \u2026 premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose\u201d brings sweet peace and assurance to our mind and heart. Knowing who you are begins with understanding God\u2019s foreordained blessings bestowed upon you before you were ever born on this earth. Our Heavenly Father desires to reveal to you your personal foreordination, and He will do so as you seek to learn and follow His will.\nI love to read President Nelson\u2019s Instagram posts. One of my favorites was on July&nbsp;20, 2022. He wrote:\n\u201cI believe that if the Lord were speaking to you directly, the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity. My dear friends, you are literally spirit children of God.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;Make no mistake about it: Your potential is divine. With your diligent seeking, God will give you glimpses of who you may become.\u201d\nMay I share with you how my earthly father taught me to discover my identity and God\u2019s plan in my life?\nOne Saturday morning when I was 13 years old, I was mowing the grass as part of my weekly chores. When I finished, I heard the door close at the back of our house and looked to see my father calling me to join him. I walked to the back porch, and he invited me to sit with him on the steps. It was a beautiful morning. I still recall him sitting so close to me that our shoulders were touching. He began by telling me he loved me. He asked me what my goals were in life. I thought, \u201cWell, that\u2019s easy.\u201d I knew two things for sure: I wanted to be taller, and I wanted to go camping more often. I was a simple soul. He smiled, paused for a moment, and said: \u201cSteve, I\u2019d like to share something with you that\u2019s very important to me. I\u2019ve prayed that our Heavenly Father will cause what I say now to be indelibly imprinted in your mind and on your soul so that you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\nMy father had my full attention in that moment. He turned and looked at me in the eyes and said, \u201cSon, protect the private times of your life.\u201d There was a long pause as he let the meaning sink deep into my heart.\nHe then continued, \u201cYou know, those times when you\u2019re the only one around and no one else knows what you\u2019re doing? Those times when you think, \u2018Whatever I do now doesn\u2019t affect anyone else, only me\u2019?\u201d\n\nThen he said, \u201cMore than any other time in your life, what you do during the private times of your life will have the greatest impact on how you confront challenges and heartache you will face; and what you do during the private times of your life will also have a greater impact on how you confront the successes and joy you will experience than any other time in your life.\u201d\nMy father received the wish of his heart. The sound and cadence of his voice, and the love I felt in his words, were indelibly imprinted in my mind and on my soul that day.\nI have learned over the years that the greatest miracle of that day on the steps of my childhood home was that, in the private times of my life, I could go to God in prayer to receive revelation. My father was teaching me how I could learn of God\u2019s foreordained blessings. In those private moments, I learned the Book of Mormon is the word of God. I learned God had foreordained me to serve a mission. I learned that God knows me and hears and answers my prayers. I learned that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer.\nThough I have made many mistakes since that memorable day with my father, striving to protect the private times of my life has remained an anchor amid the storms of life and has enabled me to seek safe haven and the healing, strengthening blessings of our Savior\u2019s love and atoning sacrifice.\nMy young brothers and sisters, as you protect the private times of your life with wholesome recreation; listening to uplifting music; reading the scriptures; having regular, meaningful prayer; and making efforts to receive and ponder your patriarchal blessing, you will receive revelation. In President Nelson\u2019s words, your eyes will become \u201cwide open to the truth that this life really *is* the time when you get to decide what kind of life *you* want to live forever.\u201d\nOur Father in Heaven will answer your prayers, especially your prayers offered during the private times of your life. He will reveal to you your foreordained gifts and talents, and you will feel His love envelop you, if you will sincerely ask and genuinely desire to know. As you protect the private times of your life, your participation in the ordinances and covenants of the gospel will be more meaningful. You will more fully bind yourself to God in the covenants you make with Him, and you will be lifted to have greater hope, faith, and assurance in the promises He has made to you. Do you want to know God\u2019s plan for you? I bear witness He wants you to know, and He inspired His prophet to the world to invite each of us to pray and receive this eye-opening experience for ourselves. I bear witness to the reality and power of our Savior\u2019s atoning sacrifice that makes it possible to live up to and enjoy all of God\u2019s foreordained blessings, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Dear young friends, today I would like to speak directly to you\u2014the youth of the Church.\nIt\u2019s been a year since our Young Women General Presidency was called. How much has happened in this past year!\nWe have met many of you and have studied the teachings of Christ together. We have sung songs, made new friends, and served with you in our communities. We have been strengthened by listening to your testimonies at youth conferences and world events. And we have worshipped together in the house of the Lord.\nEach time, we have shared a message from our Lord Jesus Christ. Tonight will not be different; I have a message for you, the youth of the Church of Jesus Christ.\n\n\nThe Big Questions\n\nHave you ever wondered how you can be faithful to God while living in a world of sin? Where do you get the strength to go forward and continue doing good? How do you experience true joy?\n\nI think the experience of David and Goliath can help.\n\n\n\nDavid and Goliath\n\nIn the Old Testament, the army of the Philistines was battling the Israelites, and every morning and every evening, a giant Philistine named Goliath challenged any Israelite to fight him.\n\nAmong the Israelite people lived David, a young shepherd much smaller than Goliath but with a giant faith in Jesus Christ! David volunteered to fight. Even the king tried to dissuade him, but David chose to put his trust in Jesus Christ.\nPreviously, David had fought a lion and also a bear. From his own experience, he knew that God had protected him and made him victorious. To David, the *cause of God was the most important cause*. So, full of faith in a God who would not abandon him, he gathered five smooth stones, took up his sling, and went to face the giant.\n\nThe scriptures tell us that the first stone David threw hit Goliath\u2019s forehead, ending his life.\n\n\n\nSearching for the Answer\n\nWhile David used only one stone to kill Goliath, he was prepared with five. With five! This makes me think about how I can prepare myself to face the world.\nWhat if each of David\u2019s stones represented a strength we need to be triumphant in our lives? What could those five stones be? I thought of these possibilities:\n\n\nThe stone of *my love for God*.\n\n\nThe stone of *my faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ*.\n\n\nThe stone of *the knowledge of my true identity*.\n\n\nThe stone of *my daily repentance*.\n\n\nThe stone of *my access to God\u2019s power*.\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about how we are blessed by these strengths.\nFirst, the stone of *my love for God*. Loving God is the first great commandment. The For the Strength of Youth guide teaches us: \u201cGod loves you. He is your Father. His perfect love can inspire you to love Him. When your love for Heavenly Father is the most important influence in your life, many decisions become easier.\u201d\nOur love for God and our close relationship with Him give us the strength we need to transform our hearts and more easily overcome our challenges.\nSecond, the stone of *my faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ*. When Jesus Christ came to earth, He suffered for our sins, and He took upon Himself our sorrows, our pains, our weaknesses, and our physical and mental illnesses. That\u2019s why He knows how to help us. Having faith in Jesus Christ means to fully trust His wisdom, His timing, His love, and His power to atone for our sins. The stone of faith in Jesus Christ will defeat any \u201cgiant\u201d in our lives. We can overcome this fallen world because He overcame it first.\nNumber three, the stone of *the knowledge of my true identity*. Our beloved prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, taught us that our most important identities are as children of God, children of the covenant, and disciples of Jesus Christ.\nEverything changes when I know who I really am. When I doubt my abilities, I often repeat to myself in my mind or out loud, \u201cI am a daughter of God, I am a daughter of God,\u201d as many times as I need until I again feel confident to keep going.\nFourth, the stone of *my daily repentance*. In the For the Strength of Youth guide, we read: \u201cRepentance isn\u2019t punishment for sin; it is the way the Savior frees us from sin. To repent means to change\u2015to turn away from sin and toward God. It means to improve and receive forgiveness. This kind of change is not a one-time event; it\u2019s an ongoing process.\u201d\nNothing is more liberating than feeling God\u2019s forgiveness and knowing that we are clean and reconciled with Him. Forgiveness is possible for everyone.\nThe fifth stone is the stone of *my access to God\u2019s power*. The covenants we make with God, such as those we make in the ordinance of baptism, give us access to the power of godliness. God\u2019s power is a real power that helps us face challenges, make good decisions, and increase our capacity to endure difficult situations. It is a power with which we can grow in the specific abilities that we need.\nThe For the Strength of Youth guide explains: \u201cCovenants *connect* you to Heavenly Father and the Savior. They *increase God\u2019s power* in your life.\u201d\nLet\u2019s talk about that connection. Remember when Christ taught the difference between a house built on rock and one on sand? Elder Dieter&nbsp;F. Uchtdorf explained: \u201cA house doesn\u2019t survive in a storm because the house is strong. It also doesn\u2019t survive just because the rock is strong. The house survives the storm because it is firmly attached to that strong rock. It\u2019s the strength of the *connection* to the rock that matters.\u201d\n\nOur personal connection to Jesus Christ will give us the courage and confidence to move forward amid people who do not respect our beliefs or who bully us. Christ invites us to keep Him in our thoughts constantly; He tells us, \u201cLook unto me in *every* thought.\u201d Thinking about the Savior gives us clarity of mind to make decisions, to act without fear, and to say no to what is contrary to God\u2019s teachings. When my day is difficult and I feel like I can\u2019t take any more, thinking about Christ brings me peace and gives me hope.\nHow can we draw upon this power of Jesus Christ? Obeying our covenants and increasing our faith in Jesus Christ are key.\nI actually wish David had had one more stone; that would be the stone of *my testimony*. Our testimony is built by personal spiritual experiences in which we recognize the divine influence in our lives. No one can take that knowledge from us. Knowing what we know from having lived our spiritual experiences is priceless. Being true to that knowledge gives us freedom. It gives us joy! If we love the truth, we will seek it, and once we find it, we will defend it.\n\n\n\nAn Invitation\n\nJust as I chose stone number six, I invite you to meet with your class, quorum, or family and think about what other strengths you need to acquire to remain faithful to God and, therefore, overcome the world.\n\n\n\nA Promise\n\nDear friends, Christ is eager to accompany us on the journey of our lives. I promise you, as you hold on to the iron rod, you will walk hand in hand with Jesus Christ. *He* will be guiding you, and *He* will be teaching you. By *His* hand, you will be able to bring down every Goliath that appears in your life.\n\n\n\nTestimony\n\nI testify that there is joy in praying every day, in reading the Book of Mormon every day, in partaking of the sacrament every Sunday, and in going to seminary\u2014even in the early morning! There is joy in doing good.\nThere is joy in being faithful to the God of the universe, the Savior of the world, the King of kings. There is joy in being a disciple of Jesus Christ.\nGod is our Father. He knows your heart\u2019s desires and your possibilities, and He trusts you.\nDear youth, Jesus Christ will help you to be faithful to the end. Of these truths I bear my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

When fully matured peaches are picked, they last two to four days before they spoil. I have fond memories of joining with my mother and my siblings in our kitchen as we would preserve harvested peaches for the coming winter by sealing them in bottles. If we preserved the peaches correctly, this delicious fruit would last several years, not just two to four days. If properly prepared and heated, the fruit is preserved until the seal is broken.\nChrist directed us to \u201cgo and bring forth fruit, \u2026 that your fruit should remain.\u201d But He wasn\u2019t speaking about peaches. He was talking about God\u2019s blessings to His children. If we make and keep covenants with God, the blessings associated with our covenants can extend beyond this life and be sealed upon us, or preserved, forever, becoming fruit that remains for all eternity.\nThe Holy Ghost, in His divine role as the Holy Spirit of Promise, will seal each ordinance upon those who are faithful to their covenants so that it will be valid after mortality. Having the Holy Ghost seal our ordinances is essential if we want to have the promised blessings for all eternity, becoming fruit that remains.\nThis is particularly important if we want to be exalted. As President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught, we should \u201cbegin with the end in mind. \u2026 Surely, for each of us, the \u2018end\u2019 we would most like to achieve is to live forever with our families in an exalted state where we will be in the presence of God, our Heavenly Father, and His Son Jesus Christ.\u201d President Nelson has also said: \u201cCelestial marriage is a pivotal part of preparation for eternal life. It requires one to be married to the right person, in the right place, by the right authority, and to obey that sacred covenant faithfully. Then one may be assured of exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God.\u201d\nWhat are the blessings of exaltation? They include dwelling in God\u2019s presence for eternity together as husband and wife, inheriting \u201cthrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, \u2026 and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever,\u201d receiving all that God the Father has.\nThe Lord revealed through Joseph Smith:\n\u201cIn the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;\n\u201cAnd in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];\n\u201cAnd if he does not, he cannot obtain it.\n\u201cHe may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.\u201d\nWe learn here that one can be in the celestial kingdom, or dwell in the presence of God, and be single. But to be exalted in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom, one must enter into marriage by the proper authority and then be true to the covenants made in that marriage. As we are faithful to these covenants, the Holy Spirit of Promise can seal our marriage covenant. Such sealed blessings become fruit that remains.\nWhat is required to faithfully keep the new and everlasting covenant of marriage?\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught there are two types of bonds when we enter into this eternal marriage covenant: a lateral bond between husband and wife, and a vertical bond with God. To have the blessings of exaltation sealed upon us and remain after this life, we must be true to both the lateral and the vertical bonds of the covenant.\nTo keep the lateral bond with your spouse, God has counseled us to \u201clove [your] wife [or husband] with all [your] heart, and \u2026 cleave unto her [or him] and none else.\u201d For those who are married, to cleave unto her or him and none else means you counsel together in love, you love and care for each other, you prioritize time with your spouse over outside interests, and you call upon God to help you overcome your weaknesses. It also means there is no emotional intimacy or sexual relations of any kind outside of your marriage, including flirting or dating, and there is no pornography, which engenders lust.\nTo keep the lateral bond in the covenant, each partner must desire to be in the marriage. President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks recently taught: \u201cWe also know that He [God] will force no one into a sealing relationship against his or her will. The blessings of a sealed relationship are assured for all who keep their covenants *but never by forcing a sealed relationship on another person who is unworthy or unwilling*.\u201d\nWhat is the vertical bond referred to by President Nelson? The vertical bond is one we make with God.\nTo keep the vertical bond with God, we are true to the temple covenants we have made regarding the laws of obedience, sacrifice, the gospel, chastity, and consecration. We also covenant with God to receive our eternal companion and to be a righteous spouse and parent. As we keep the vertical bond, we qualify for the blessings of being part of the family of God through the Abrahamic covenant, including the blessings of posterity, the gospel, and the priesthood. These blessings are also the fruit that remains.\nWhile we hope that all who enter into the new and everlasting covenant remain true and have the blessings sealed upon them for all eternity, sometimes that ideal seems beyond our reach. Throughout my ministry I have encountered members who make and keep covenants while their spouse does not. There are also those who are single, never having the opportunity to marry in mortality. And there are those who are not faithful in their marriage covenants. What happens to individuals in each of these circumstances?\n\n\nIf you remain faithful to the covenants you made when you were endowed, you will receive the personal blessings promised to you in the endowment *even if your spouse has broken his or her covenants or withdrawn from the marriage*. If you were sealed and later divorced, and if your sealing is not canceled, the personal blessings of that sealing remain in effect for you if you remain faithful.\n\nSometimes, due to feelings of betrayal and very real hurt, a faithful spouse may want to cancel their sealing with their unfaithful spouse to get as far away as possible from them, both on earth and for eternity. If you are concerned that you will somehow be tied to an unrepentant former spouse, remember, *you will not*! God will not require anyone to remain in a sealed relationship throughout eternity against his or her will. Heavenly Father will ensure that we will receive every blessing that our desires and choices allow.\nHowever, if a cancellation of sealing is desired, agency is respected. Certain procedures can be followed. *But this should not be done casually*! The First Presidency holds the keys to bind on earth and in heaven. Once a sealing cancellation has been granted by the First Presidency, the blessings related to that sealing are no longer in force; they are canceled both laterally and vertically. It is important to understand that to receive the blessings of exaltation, we must demonstrate that we are willing to enter into and faithfully keep this new and everlasting covenant, either in this life or the next.\n\n\nFor those who are single members of the Church, please remember that \u201cin the Lord\u2019s own way and time, no blessings will be withheld from His faithful Saints. The Lord will judge and reward each individual according to heartfelt [desires] as well as deed.\u201d\n\n\nIf you have not remained faithful to temple covenants, is there hope? Yes! The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of hope. That hope comes through Jesus Christ with sincere repentance and obediently following Christ\u2019s teachings. I have seen individuals make grave mistakes, breaking sacred covenants. On a regular basis, I see those who sincerely repent, are forgiven, and return to the covenant path. If you have broken your temple covenants, I urge you to turn to Jesus Christ, counsel with your bishop, repent, and open your soul to the *mighty* healing power available because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\n\nBrothers and sisters, our loving Heavenly Father has given us covenants so that we may have access to all that He has in store for us. These sacred blessings from God are more delicious than any earthly fruit. They can be preserved for us forever, becoming fruit that remains, as we are faithful to our covenants.\nI testify that God has restored the authority to bind on earth and in heaven. That authority is found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is held by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve and is exercised under the direction of President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson. Those who enter into the new and everlasting covenant of marriage and keep that covenant can become perfected and eventually receive the fulness of the glory of the Father, regardless of circumstances beyond their control.\nThese promised blessings appertaining to our covenants can be sealed upon us by the Holy Spirit of Promise and become fruit that remains forever and ever. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

The sealing power confers a seal of legitimacy upon your baptism, for example, so that it is recognized here and in heaven. Ultimately, all priesthood ordinances are performed under the keys of the President of the Church, and as President Joseph Fielding Smith explained, \u2018He [the President of the Church] has given us authority, he has put the sealing power in our priesthood, because he holds those keys\u2019 [quoted by Harold&nbsp;B. Lee, in Conference Report, Oct. 1944,&nbsp;75]\u201d (D.&nbsp;Todd Christofferson, \u201c[The Sealing Power](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/15christofferson?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10),\u201d Liahona, Nov. 2023,&nbsp;20).\n\u201cAn act which is sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise is one which is ratified by the Holy Ghost; it is one which is approved by the Lord. \u2026 No one can lie to the Holy Ghost and get by undetected. \u2026 These principles also apply to every other ordinance and performance in the Church. Thus if both parties [in a marriage] are \u2018just and true\u2019 [[[D&C 76|Doctrine and Covenants 76:53]]], if they are worthy, a ratifying seal is placed on their temple marriage; if they are unworthy, they are not justified by the Spirit and the ratification of the Holy Ghost is withheld. Subsequent worthiness will put the seal in force, and unrighteousness will break any seal\u201d (Bruce&nbsp;R. McConkie, \u201c[Holy Spirit of Promise](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/eternal-marriage-student-manual/holy-spirit-of-promise?lang=eng&amp;id=p2,p5-p6#p2),\u201d in Preparing for an Eternal Marriage Student Manual [2003],&nbsp;136).\n\u201c*The Holy Spirit of Promise is the Holy Ghost* who places the stamp of approval upon every ordinance: baptism, confirmation, ordination, marriage. *The promise is that the blessings will be received through faithfulness*. If a person violates a covenant, whether it be of baptism, ordination, marriage or anything else, the Spirit withdraws the stamp of approval, and the blessings will not be received. Every ordinance is sealed with a promise of a reward based upon faithfulness. The Holy Spirit withdraws the stamp of approval where covenants are broken\u201d (Joseph Fielding Smith, Doctrines of Salvation, comp. Bruce&nbsp;R. McConkie [1954], 1:45)."

As we taught this couple about the restored Church of Jesus Christ, the woman showed great interest in what we were teaching. Over the next few weeks, she gained a testimony of the reality that the Church of Jesus Christ was restored with correct authority from God and that Jesus Christ directs His Church through living prophets and apostles. We looked forward to teaching this couple about one of the most sublime doctrines of the Restoration, the opportunity for eternal marriage. Surprisingly, however, as we taught this couple about the doctrine of eternal marriage, the Swiss woman remarked that she had no interest in being with her husband for all eternity. To her, heaven did not include being with her husband, to whom she had been married for 36&nbsp;years. This sister was baptized, but her husband was not. They were never sealed in the temple.\nTo many, however, heaven would not be heaven without being with the person to whom they are married. To be together with the spouse you love forever truly sounds like heaven. As Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland shared about his dear, beloved wife, Pat, heaven would not be heaven without her (see \u201cScott Taylor: For Elder Holland, Heaven without His Wife and Children \u2018Wouldn\u2019t Be Heaven for Me,\u2019\u201d Church News, July&nbsp;22, 2023, thechurchnews.com)."

        "full_markdown": "I have had the great blessing of speaking at general conference for three decades now. During that time, I have been asked questions relating to these messages by many around the world. Lately, one particular question keeps coming up. It usually goes something like this: \u201cElder Uchtdorf, I listened carefully to your last talk, but \u2026 I didn\u2019t hear anything about aviation.\u201d\nWell, after today, I might not hear that question for a while.\n\n\nOn \u201cthe Tumbling Mirth of Sun-Split Clouds\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe it was only 120 years ago when Wilbur and Orville Wright first lifted off and flew over the sands of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Four short flights on that December day changed the world and opened the door to one of the greatest inventions in the world\u2019s history.\nFlying was risky in those early days. The brothers knew this. And so did their father, Milton. In fact, he was so terrified of losing both of his sons in a flying accident that they promised him they would never fly together.\nAnd they never did\u2014with one exception. Seven years after that historic day at Kitty Hawk, Milton Wright finally gave his consent and watched as Wilbur and Orville flew together for the first time. After landing, Orville convinced his father to take his first and only flight and to see for himself what it was like.\nAs the plane lifted from the ground, the 82-year-old Milton got so caught up in the exhilaration of flight that all fear left him. Orville rejoiced as his father shouted with delight, \u201cHigher, Orville, higher!\u201d\nThis was a man after my own heart!\nPerhaps the reason I speak about aviation occasionally is that I know something of what the Wrights felt. I too have \u201cslipped the surly bonds of Earth and danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings.\u201d\nThe Wright brothers\u2019 first flight, which happened a mere 37 years before my birth, opened doors of adventure, wonder, and pure joy into my life.\nAnd yet, as amazing as that joy is, there is an even higher kind of joy. Today, in the spirit of Milton Wright\u2019s delighted cry, \u201cHigher, Orville, higher,\u201d I would like to speak about this higher joy\u2014where it comes from, how it enters our hearts, and how we can experience it in greater measure.\n\n\n\nThe Whole Aim of Human Existence\n\nIt probably goes without saying that everyone wants to be happy. Nevertheless, it also goes without saying that not everyone is happy. Sadly, it seems that for many people, happiness is hard to find.\nWhy is that? If happiness is the one thing we humans desire most, why are we so unsuccessful at finding it? To paraphrase a country song, maybe we\u2019ve been looking for joy in all the wrong places.\n\n\n\nWhere Can We Find Happiness?\n\nBefore we discuss how to find joy, allow me to acknowledge that depression and other difficult mental and emotional challenges are real, and the answer is not simply \u201cTry to be happier.\u201d My purpose today is not to diminish or trivialize mental health issues. If you face such challenges, I mourn with you, and I stand beside you. For some people, finding joy may include seeking help from trained mental health professionals who devote their lives to practicing their very important art. We should be thankful for such help.\nLife is not an endless sequence of emotional highs. \u201cFor it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.\u201d And if God Himself weeps, as the scriptures affirm He does, then of course you and I will weep as well. Feeling sad is not a sign of failure. In this life, at least, joy and sorrow are inseparable companions. Like all of you, I have felt my share of disappointment, sorrow, sadness, and remorse.\nHowever, I have also experienced for myself the glorious dawn that fills the soul with joy so profound that it can scarcely be kept in. I have discovered for myself that this peaceful confidence comes from following the Savior and walking in His Way.\nThe peace He gives us is not like what the world gives. It\u2019s better. It\u2019s higher and holier. Jesus said, \u201cI am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201d\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is truly the \u201cgood news of great joy\u201d! It is a message of matchless hope! A message of yoke-bearing and burden-lifting. Of light-gathering. Of heavenly favor, higher understanding, holier covenants, eternal security, and everlasting glory!\nJoy is the very purpose of God\u2019s plan for His children. It\u2019s what you were created for\u2014\u201cthat [you] might have joy\u201d! You were built for this!\nOur Father in Heaven has not hidden the path to happiness. It is not a secret. It is available to all!\nIt is promised to those who walk the path of discipleship, follow the teachings and example of the Savior, keep His commandments, and honor covenants they make with God. What a remarkable promise!\n\n\n\nGod Has Something More to Offer\n\nWe all know people who say that they don\u2019t need God to be happy, that they are happy enough without religion.\nI acknowledge and respect these feelings. Our beloved Father in Heaven wants all His children to have as much happiness as possible, so He has filled this world with beautiful, wholesome pleasures and delights, \u201cboth to please the eye and \u2026 gladden the heart.\u201d For me, flying brought great happiness. Others find it in music, in art, in hobbies, or in nature.\nBy inviting everyone and sharing the Savior\u2019s good news of great joy, we do not discount any of these sources of joy. We\u2019re simply saying that God has something more to give. A higher and more profound joy\u2014a joy that transcends anything this world offers. It is a joy that endures heartbreak, penetrates sorrow, and diminishes loneliness.\nWorldly happiness, by contrast, does not last. It cannot. It is the nature of all earthly things to grow old, decay, wear out, or become stale. But godly joy is eternal, because God is eternal. Jesus Christ came to lift us out of the temporal and replace corruption with incorruption. Only He has that power, and only His joy is perpetual.\nIf you feel there could be more of this kind of joy in your life, I invite you to embark on the journey of following Jesus Christ and His Way. It is a journey of a lifetime\u2014and beyond. Please let me suggest a few beginning steps on this worthy journey of discovering pure joy.\n\n\n\nDraw Near unto God\n\nDo you remember the woman in the New Testament who endured a bleeding illness for 12 years? She had spent all she had on physicians, but things only grew worse. She had heard of Jesus; His power to heal was well known. But could He heal her? And how could she even get near Him? Her sickness made her \u201cunclean\u201d according to the law of Moses, and therefore she was required to stay away from others.\nApproaching Him openly and asking for healing seemed out of the question.\nStill, she thought, \u201cIf I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.\u201d\nAt last, her faith overcame her fear. She braved the censure of others and pressed toward the Savior.\nFinally, she was within reach. She extended her hand.\nAnd she was healed.\nAren\u2019t we all somewhat like this woman?\nThere may be many reasons why we hesitate to draw near to the Savior. We may face ridicule or condemnation by others. In our pride, we may dismiss the possibility of something so simple being of so much value. We may think that our condition somehow disqualifies us from His healing\u2014that the distance is too great or our sins too many.\nLike this woman, I have learned that if we draw near to God and reach out to touch Him, we can indeed find healing, peace, and joy.\n\n\n\nLook for It\n\nJesus taught, \u201cSeek, and ye shall find.\u201d\nI believe this simple phrase is not only a spiritual promise; it is a statement of fact.\nIf we seek reasons to be angry, to doubt, to be bitter or alone, we will find them too.\nHowever, if we seek joy\u2014if we look for reasons to rejoice and to happily follow the Savior, we will find them.\nWe rarely find something we are not looking for.\nAre you looking for joy?\nSeek, and ye shall find.\n\n\n\nBear One Another\u2019s Burdens\n\nJesus taught, \u201cIt is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d\nCan it be that in our search for joy, the best way to find it is to bring joy to others?\nBrothers and sisters, you know and I know this is true! Joy is like a barrel of flour or a jar of oil that will never run out. True joy multiplies when it is shared.\nIt doesn\u2019t require something grand or complicated.\nWe can do simple things.\nLike praying for someone with all our heart.\nGiving a sincere compliment.\nHelping someone feel welcome, respected, valued, and loved.\nSharing a favorite scripture and what it means to us.\nOr even just by listening.\n\u201cWhen ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God,\u201d and God will repay your kindness generously. The joy you give to others will return to you in \u201cgood measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat Shall We Do Then?\u201d\n\nDuring the coming days, weeks, and months, may I invite you to:\n\n\nSpend time in a sincere, full-hearted effort to draw near to God.\n\n\nSeek diligently for everyday moments of hope, peace, and joy.\n\n\nBring joy to others around you.\n\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, dear friends, as you search the word of God for a deeper understanding of God\u2019s eternal plan, accept these invitations, and strive to walk in His Way, you will experience \u201cthe peace of God, which passeth all understanding,\u201d even in the midst of sorrows. You will feel a greater measure of God\u2019s unsurpassable love swelling within your heart. The dawn of celestial light will penetrate the shadows of your trials, and you will begin to taste the unspeakable glories and wonders of the unseen, perfect, heavenly sphere. You will feel your spirit lifting away from the gravity of this world.\nAnd like good Milton Wright, perhaps you will raise your voice in rejoicing and shout, \u201cHigher, Father, higher!\u201d\nMay we all seek and find the higher joy that comes from devoting our lives to our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son. This is my earnest prayer and blessing in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Brothers, sisters, and friends across the world, I am honored to address this vast audience, many of whom are members of our Church and many of whom are friends and new listeners to this conference broadcast. Welcome!\nThe messages shared from this pulpit are communicated in words. They are given in English and translated into nearly 100 different languages. Always the base is the same. Words. And words matter a lot. Let me say that again. Words matter!\nThey are the bedrock of how we connect; they represent our beliefs, morals, and perspectives. Sometimes we speak words; other times we listen. Words set a tone. They voice our thoughts, feelings, and experiences, for good or bad.\nUnfortunately, words can be thoughtless, hasty, and hurtful. Once said, we cannot take them back. They can wound, punish, cut down, and even lead to destructive actions. They can weigh heavily on us.\nOn the other hand, words can celebrate victory, be hopeful and encouraging. They can prompt us to rethink, reboot, and redirect our course. Words can open our minds to truth.\nThat is why, first and foremost, the Lord\u2019s words matter.\nIn the Book of Mormon, the prophet Alma and his people in ancient America encountered endless warfare with those who had disregarded the word of God, hardened their hearts, and corrupted their culture. The faithful could have fought, but Alma counseled: \u201cAnd now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just\u2014yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them\u2014therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.\u201d\nThe \u201cword of God\u201d surpasses all other expressions. It has been so since the Creation of the earth when the Lord spoke: \u201cLet there be light: and there was light.\u201d\nFrom the Savior came these assurances in the New Testament: \u201cHeaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\u201d\nAnd this: \u201cIf a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\u201d\nAnd from Mary, the mother of Jesus, came this humble testimony: \u201cBehold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.\u201d\nBelieving and heeding the word of God will draw us closer to Him. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has promised, \u201cIf you will study His words, your ability to be more like Him will increase.\u201d\nDon\u2019t we all want to be, as the hymn says, \u201cmore blessed and holy\u2014more, Savior, like thee\u201d?\nI picture young Joseph Smith on his knees hearing the words of his Father in Heaven: \u201c[Joseph,] This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d\nWe \u201chear Him\u201d in the words of scripture, but do we let them just sit on the page, or do we recognize He is speaking to us? Do we change?\n\nWe \u201chear Him\u201d in personal revelation and promptings from the Holy Ghost, in answers to prayer, and in those moments when only Jesus Christ, through the power of His Atonement, can lift our burdens, grant us forgiveness and peace, and embrace us \u201cin the arms of his love.\u201d\nSecond, the words of prophets matter.\nProphets testify of the divinity of Jesus Christ. They teach His gospel and show His love for all. I bear my witness that our living prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, hears and speaks the word of the Lord.\nPresident Nelson has a way with words. He has said, \u201cKeep on the covenant path,\u201d \u201cGather Israel,\u201d \u201cLet God prevail,\u201d \u201cBuild bridges of understanding,\u201d \u201cGive thanks,\u201d \u201cIncrease your faith in Jesus Christ,\u201d \u201cTake charge of your testimony,\u201d and \u201cBecome a peacemaker.\u201d\nMost recently, he has asked us to \u201cthink celestial.\u201d \u201cWhen you are confronted with a dilemma,\u201d he said, \u201cthink celestial! When tested by temptation, think celestial! When life or loved ones let you down, think celestial! When someone dies prematurely, think celestial. \u2026 When the pressures of life crowd in upon you, think celestial! \u2026 As you think celestial, your heart will gradually change, \u2026 you will view trials and opposition in a new light, \u2026 [and] your faith will increase.\u201d\nWhen we think celestial, we see \u201cthings as they really are, and \u2026 really will be.\u201d In this world burdened with confusion and contention, we all need that perspective.\nElder George Albert Smith, long before becoming President of the Church, spoke of sustaining the prophet and heeding his words. He said: \u201cThe obligation that we make when we raise our hands \u2026 is a most sacred one. \u2026 It means \u2026 that we will stand behind him; we will pray for him; \u2026 and we will strive to carry out his instructions as the Lord shall direct.\u201d In other words, we will diligently act upon our prophet\u2019s words.\nAs one of 15 prophets, seers, and revelators sustained yesterday by our worldwide Church, I want to share with you one of my experiences sustaining the prophet and embracing his words. It was for me much like the prophet Jacob, who recounted, \u201cI had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word.\u201d\n\nLast October my wife, Melanie, and I were in Bangkok, Thailand, as I was preparing to dedicate what would be the Church\u2019s 185th temple. For me, the assignment was both surreal and humbling. This was the first temple on the Southeast Asia peninsula. It was masterfully designed\u2014a six-story, nine-spired structure, \u201cfitly framed\u201d to be a house of the Lord. For months I had contemplated the dedication. What had settled in my soul and mind was that the country and the temple had been cradled in the arms of prophets and apostles. President Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson had announced the temple and President Nelson the dedication.\n\nI had prepared the dedicatory prayer months earlier. Those sacred words had been translated into 12 languages. We were ready. Or so I thought.\nThe night before the dedication, I was awakened from my sleep with an unsettled, urgent feeling about the dedicatory prayer. I tried to set aside the prompting, thinking the prayer was in place. But the Spirit would not leave me alone. I sensed certain words were missing, and by divine design they came to me in revelation, and I inserted these words in the prayer near the end: \u201cMay we think celestial, letting Thy Spirit prevail in our lives, and strive to be peacemakers always.\u201d The Lord was reminding me to heed the words of our living prophet: \u201cThink celestial,\u201d \u201clet the Spirit prevail,\u201d \u201cstrive to be peacemakers.\u201d Words of the prophet matter to the Lord and to us.\nThird, and so very important, are our own words. Believe me, in our emoji-filled world, our words matter.\nOur words can be supportive or angry, joyful or mean, compassionate or tossed aside. In the heat of the moment, words can sting and sink painfully deep into the soul\u2014and stay there. Our words on the internet, texting, social media, or tweets take on a life of their own. So be careful what you say and how you say it. In our families, especially with husbands, wives, and children, our words can bring us together or drive a wedge between us.\nLet me suggest three simple phrases that we can use to take the sting out of difficulties and differences, lift, and reassure each other:\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry.\u201d\nAnd \u201cI love you.\u201d\nDo not save these humble phrases for a special event or catastrophe. Use them often and sincerely, for they show regard for others. Talk is growing cheap; do not follow that pattern.\nWe can say \u201cthank you\u201d on the elevator, in the parking lot, at the market, in the office, in a queue, or with our neighbors or friends. We can say \u201cI am sorry\u201d when we make a mistake, miss a meeting, forget a birthday, or see someone in pain. We can say \u201cI love you,\u201d and those words carry the message \u201cI am thinking about you,\u201d \u201cI care about you,\u201d \u201cI am here for you,\u201d or \u201cYou are everything to me.\u201d\nLet me share a personal example. Husbands, take heed. Sisters, this is going to help you too. Before my full-time assignment in the Church, I traveled widely for my company. I was gone a fair amount of time to far reaches of the world. At the end of my day, no matter where I was, I always called home. When my wife, Melanie, picked up the phone and I reported in, our conversation always led us to expressing \u201cI love you.\u201d Every day, those words served as an anchor to my soul and my conduct; they were a protection to me from evil designs. \u201cMelanie, I love you\u201d spoke of the precious trust between us.\nPresident Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson used to say, \u201cThere are feet to steady, hands to grasp, minds to encourage, hearts to inspire, and souls to save.\u201d Saying \u201cthank you,\u201d \u201cI am sorry,\u201d \u201cI love you\u201d will do just that.\nBrothers and sisters, words do matter.\nI promise that if we \u201cfeast upon the words of Christ\u201d that lead to salvation, our prophet\u2019s words that guide and encourage us, and our own words that speak of who we are and what we hold dear, the powers of heaven will pour down upon us. \u201cThe words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.\u201d We are Heavenly Father\u2019s children and He is our God, and He expects us to speak with \u201cthe tongue of angels\u201d by the power of the Holy Ghost.\nI love the Lord Jesus Christ. He is, in the words of the Old Testament prophet Isaiah, \u201cWonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\u201d And as the Apostle John made clear, Jesus Christ Himself is \u201cthe Word.\u201d\nOf this I testify as an Apostle called to the Lord\u2019s divine service\u2014to declare His word\u2014and called to stand as a special witness of Him. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Brothers and sisters, I feel joy as I respond to an impression to speak to children!\nGirls and boys, wherever you are in the world, I want to share something with you.\nOur Heavenly Father loves you! You are His child. He knows you. He wants to bless you. I pray with all my heart that you will feel His love.\nDo you like to receive gifts? I want to talk to you about a very special gift that Heavenly Father has given to you to help you. It is the gift of prayer. What a blessing prayer is! We can talk to Heavenly Father anytime, anywhere.\n\nWhen Jesus was on the earth, He taught us to pray. He said, \u201cAsk, and ye shall receive.\u201d\nWhat gifts can you pray for? There are many, but today I want to share three:\n\n\nPray to know.\n\n\nPray to grow.\n\n\nPray to show.\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about each one.\n\n\nFirst, Pray to Know\n\nWhat do you need to *know*?\nThere is a song about prayer that Primary children sing all over the world. It starts with a question. Do you know what song it is? If I were really brave, I would sing it to you!\n\u201cHeavenly Father, are you really there? And do you hear and answer ev\u2019ry child\u2019s prayer?\u201d\nHow can you know that Heavenly Father is really there, even when you can\u2019t see Him?\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has invited you to \u201cpour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. \u2026 And then listen!\u201d Listen to what you feel in your heart and to thoughts that come to your mind.\nHeavenly Father has a glorified body of flesh and bones and is the Father of your spirit. Because Heavenly Father has all power and knows all things, He can see all His children and can hear and answer every prayer. You can come to *know* for yourself that He is there and that He loves you.\nWhen you know that Heavenly Father is real and that He loves you, you can live with courage and hope! \u201cPray, he is there; speak, he is list\u2019ning.\u201d\nHave you ever felt alone? One day when our granddaughter Ashley was six years old, she was the only one without a friend to play with on the school playground. As she stood there, feeling unimportant and unseen, a specific thought came into her mind: \u201cWait! I\u2019m not alone! I have Christ!\u201d Ashley knelt down right in the middle of the playground, folded her arms, and prayed to Heavenly Father. The moment she opened her eyes, a girl her age was standing there asking her if she wanted to play. Ashley came to know, \u201cWe are important to the Lord, and we are never truly alone.\u201d\nSometimes you may want to *know* why something hard is happening in your life or why you didn\u2019t receive a blessing you prayed for. Often the best question to ask Heavenly Father is not *why* but *what*.\nDo you remember when Nephi and his family were hungry while they were traveling in the wilderness? When Nephi and his brothers went to hunt for food, Nephi broke his bow. But he didn\u2019t ask why.\n\nNephi made a new bow and asked his father, Lehi, where he could go to get food. Lehi prayed, and the Lord showed them where Nephi could go. Heavenly Father will guide you when you ask Him *what* you can do and *what* you can learn.\n\n\n\nSecond, Pray to Grow\n\nHeavenly Father wants to help you *grow*! He loves us so much that He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to show us the way to live. Jesus suffered, died, and was resurrected so we can be forgiven of our sins and *grow* to become more like Him.\nDo you want to *grow* in patience or in honesty? Do you want to *grow* in a skill? Maybe you are shy and want to *grow* in courage. \u201cPray, he is there\u201d! Through His Spirit, your heart can change, and you can receive strength.\nMy new friend Jonah wrote: \u201cI often feel nervous on my way to school in the morning. I worry about things like being late, forgetting something, and taking tests. When I was 10, I started saying prayers on my drive to school with my mom. I ask for the help I need, and I pray for my family too. I also think of the things I\u2019m grateful for. [Praying to Heavenly Father has] helped me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel the relief right as I get out of the car, but by the time I\u2019m at my classroom, I feel peaceful.\u201d\nJonah\u2019s faith is *growing* as he prays every day and then moves forward.\n\n\n\nThird, Pray to Show\n\nYou can pray for help to *show* Heavenly Father\u2019s love to others. Through His Spirit, Heavenly Father will help you notice someone who is sad so you can comfort them. He can help you *show* His love by forgiving someone. He can give you courage to serve someone and share with them that they are a child of God. You can help others come to know and love Jesus and Heavenly Father as you do.\nFor my whole life I prayed that my father would become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Even as a young girl, I knew how many blessings *he* could receive. Our *family* could receive the blessings of being sealed for eternity. My family, friends, and I prayed often for him, but he didn\u2019t join the Church. Heavenly Father does not force anyone to make a choice. He can send us answers to our prayers in other ways.\n\nWhen I was old enough, I received my patriarchal blessing. In the blessing, the patriarch told me the best thing I could do to help my family be together in heaven was to be an example of the gospel of Jesus Christ. That\u2019s what I could do!\nMy father lived to be 86. Five days after he died, I received a sacred feeling of joy. Heavenly Father let me know through His Spirit that my father wanted to receive the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ! I will never forget the day I knelt around the altar in the temple with my sister and brothers to be sealed to my parents. I had started praying for this blessing when I was in Primary, and I received it when I was a grandmother.\nPerhaps you are praying for blessings for your family and others you love. Don\u2019t give up! Heavenly Father will *show* you what you can do.\nShare with Heavenly Father what is in your heart. As you sincerely ask for His help, you will receive His Spirit to guide you. Praying every day will fill you with love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. This will help you want to follow Them your whole life!\nImagine what would happen if all the children in Africa, South America, Asia, Europe, North America, and Australia prayed every day. The whole world would be blessed with more of God\u2019s love!\n\n\nI invite you to *pray to know* Heavenly Father is there, *pray to grow* to become like Him, and *pray to show* His love to others. I know He lives and loves *you*. \u201cPray, he is there.\u201d In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Years ago, my wife, Ruth; our daughter, Ashley; and I joined other tourists on a kayaking excursion in the state of Hawaii in the United States. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the rower sits facing forward and uses a double-bladed paddle to pull front to back on one side and then on the other. The plan was to row to two small islands off the coast of Oahu and back again. I was confident because, as a young man, I had paddled kayaks across mountain lakes. Hubris never bodes well, does it?\nOur guide gave us instructions and showed us the ocean kayaks we would use. They differed from the ones I had previously paddled. I was supposed to sit on top of the kayak, instead of down inside it. When I got onto the kayak, my center of gravity was higher than I was accustomed to, and I was less stable in the water.\nAs we started out, I rowed faster than Ruth and Ashley. After a while, I was far ahead of them. Though proud of my heroic pace, I stopped paddling and waited for them to catch up. A large wave\u2014about 13 centimeters\u2014hit the side of my kayak and flipped me over into the water. By the time I had turned the kayak upright and struggled to get back on top, Ruth and Ashley had passed me by, but I was too winded to resume paddling. Before I could catch my breath, another wave, this one truly enormous\u2014at least 20 centimeters\u2014hit my kayak and flipped me over again. By the time I managed to right the kayak, I was so out of breath I feared I would not be able to climb on top.\nSeeing my situation, the guide rowed over and steadied my kayak, making it easier for me to climb on top. When he saw that I was still too breathless to row on my own, he hitched a towrope to my kayak and began paddling, pulling me along with him. Soon I caught my breath and began paddling adequately on my own. He let go of the rope, and I reached the first island without further assistance. Upon arrival, I flopped down on the sand, exhausted.\nAfter the group had rested, the guide quietly said to me, \u201cMr. Renlund, if you just keep paddling, maintaining your momentum, I think you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d I followed his advice as we paddled to the second island and then back to our starting point. Twice the guide rowed by and told me I was doing great. Even larger waves hit my kayak from the side, but I was not flipped over.\nBy consistently paddling the kayak, I maintained momentum and forward progress, mitigating the effect of waves hitting me from the side. The same principle applies in our spiritual lives. We become vulnerable when we slow down and especially when we stop. If we maintain spiritual momentum by continually \u201crowing\u201d toward the Savior, we are safer and more secure because our eternal life depends on our faith in Him.\nSpiritual momentum is created \u201cover a lifetime as we repeatedly embrace the doctrine of Christ.\u201d Doing so, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught, produces a \u201cpowerful virtuous cycle.\u201d Indeed, the elements of the doctrine of Christ\u2014such as faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, entering a covenant relationship with the Lord through baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end\u2014are not intended to be experienced as one-time, check-the-box events. In particular, \u201cenduring to the end\u201d is not really a separate step in the doctrine of Christ\u2014as though we complete the first four elements and then hunker down, grit our teeth, and wait to die. No, enduring to the end is repeatedly and iteratively applying the other elements of the doctrine of Christ, creating the \u201cpowerful virtuous cycle\u201d that President Nelson described.\n*Repeatedly* means that we experience the elements of the doctrine of Christ over and over throughout our lives. *Iteratively* means that we build on and improve with each repetition. Even though we repeat the elements, we are not just spinning in circles without a forward trajectory. Instead, we draw closer to Jesus Christ each time through the cycle.\nMomentum involves both speed and direction. If I had paddled the kayak vigorously in the wrong direction, I could have created significant momentum, but I would not have reached the intended destination. Similarly, in life, we need to \u201crow\u201d toward the Savior to come unto Him.\nOur faith in Jesus Christ needs to be nourished daily. It is nourished as we pray daily, study the scriptures daily, reflect on the goodness of God daily, repent daily, and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost daily. Just as it is not healthy to defer eating all our food until Sunday and then binge our weekly allotment of nutrition, it is not spiritually healthy to restrict our testimony-nourishing behavior to one day in the week.\nWhen we assume responsibility for our own testimonies, we gain spiritual momentum and gradually develop bedrock faith in Jesus Christ, and the doctrine of Christ becomes central to the purpose of life. Momentum likewise builds as we strive to obey the laws of God and repent. Repentance is joyful and allows us to learn from our mistakes, which is how we progress eternally. We will undoubtedly have times when we flip over in our kayaks and find ourselves in deep water. Through repentance, we can get back on top and continue, no matter how many times we have fallen off. The important part is that we do not give up.\nThe next element of the doctrine of Christ is baptism, which includes the baptism of water and, through confirmation, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. While baptism is a singular event, we renew our baptismal covenant repeatedly when we partake of the sacrament. The sacrament does not replace baptism, but it links the initial elements in the doctrine of Christ\u2014faith and repentance\u2014with reception of the Holy Ghost. As we conscientiously partake of the sacrament, we invite the Holy Ghost into our lives, just like when we were baptized and confirmed. As we keep the covenant described in the sacrament prayers, the Holy Ghost becomes our companion.\nAs the Holy Ghost exerts a greater influence in our lives, we progressively and iteratively develop Christlike attributes. Our hearts change. Our disposition to do evil diminishes. Our inclination to do good increases until we only want \u201cto do good continually.\u201d And we thereby access the heavenly power needed to endure to the end. Our faith has increased, and we are ready to repeat the powerful, virtuous cycle again.\nForward spiritual momentum also propels us to make additional covenants with God in the house of the Lord. Multiple covenants draw us closer to Christ and connect us more strongly to Him. Through these covenants, we have greater access to His power. To be clear, baptismal and temple covenants are not, in and of themselves, the source of power. The source of power is the Lord Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father. Making and keeping covenants create a conduit for Their power in our lives. As we live according to these covenants, we eventually become inheritors to all that Heavenly Father has. The momentum produced by living the doctrine of Christ not only powers the transformation of our divine nature into our eternal destiny but also motivates us to help others in appropriate ways.\nConsider how the expedition guide helped me after I flipped over in the kayak. He did not shout from afar an unhelpful question such as, \u201cMr. Renlund, what are you doing in the water?\u201d He did not paddle up and chide me, saying, \u201cMr. Renlund, you would not be in this situation if you were more physically fit.\u201d He did not start towing my kayak while I was just trying to get on top of it. And he did not correct me in front of the group. Instead, he gave me the help I needed at the time I needed it. He gave me advice when I was receptive. And he went out of his way to encourage me.\nAs we minister to others, we do not need to ask unhelpful questions or state the obvious. Most people who are struggling know that they are struggling. We should not be judgmental; our judgment is neither helpful nor welcome, and it is most often ill-informed.\nComparing ourselves to others can lead us to make pernicious errors, especially if we conclude that we are more righteous than those who are struggling. Such a comparison is like drowning hopelessly in three meters of water, seeing someone else drowning in four meters of water, judging him a greater sinner, and feeling good about yourself. After all, we are all struggling in our own way. None of us earns salvation. We never can. Jacob, in the Book of Mormon, taught, \u201cRemember, after [we] are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the grace of God that [we] are saved.\u201d We all need the Savior\u2019s infinite Atonement, not just part of it.\nWe do need all our compassion, empathy, and love as we interact with those around us. Those who are struggling \u201cneed to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in [our] words and actions.\u201d As we minister, we encourage others frequently and offer help. Even if someone is not receptive, we continue to minister as they allow. The Savior taught that \u201cunto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.\u201d The Savior\u2019s job is to heal. Our job is to love\u2014to love and minister in such a way that others are drawn to Jesus Christ. This is one of the fruits of the powerful, virtuous cycle of the doctrine of Christ.\nI invite you to live the doctrine of Christ repeatedly, iteratively, and intentionally and help others on their way. I testify that the doctrine of Christ is central to Heavenly Father\u2019s plan; it is, after all, His doctrine. As we exercise faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, we are propelled along the covenant path and motivated to help others become faithful disciples of Jesus Christ. We can become heirs in Heavenly Father\u2019s kingdom, which is the culmination of faithfully living the doctrine of Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the rower sits facing forward and uses a double-bladed paddle to pull front to back on one side and then on the other. The plan was to row to two small islands off the coast of Oahu and back again. I was confident because, as a young man, I had paddled kayaks across mountain lakes. Hubris never bodes well, does it?"

        "full_markdown": "In our family, we sometimes play a game we call \u201cThe Crazy Trust Exercise.\u201d You may have played it too. Two people stand a few feet apart, one with their back toward the other. On a signal from the person behind, the person in front falls backward into the waiting arms of their friend.\nTrust is the foundation of all relationships. A threshold question to any relationship is \u201cCan I trust the other person?\u201d A relationship forms only when people are willing to place trust in each other. It is not a relationship if one person trusts completely but the other does not.\nEach of us is a beloved spirit son or daughter of a loving Heavenly Father. But while that spiritual genealogy provides a foundation, it does not of itself create a meaningful relationship with God. A relationship can be built only when we choose to trust in Him.\nHeavenly Father desires to build a close, personal relationship with each of His spirit children. Jesus expressed that desire when He prayed, \u201cThat they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.\u201d The relationship God seeks with each spirit child is one so close and personal that He will be able to share all He has and all He is. That kind of deep, enduring relationship can develop only when built upon perfect, total trust.\nFor His part, Heavenly Father has worked from the beginning to communicate His absolute trust in the divine potential of each of His children. Trust underlies the plan He presented for our growth and progression prior to our coming to earth. He would teach us eternal laws, create an earth, provide us with mortal bodies, give us the gift to choose for ourselves, and permit us to learn and grow by making our own choices. He wants us to choose to follow His laws and return to enjoy eternal life with Him and His Son.\nKnowing that we would not always make good choices, He also prepared a way for us to escape from the consequences of bad choices. He provided us a Savior\u2014His Son, Jesus Christ\u2014to atone for our sins and make us clean again on condition of repentance. He invites us to use the precious gift of repentance regularly.\nEvery parent knows how difficult it is to trust a child enough to let them make their own decisions, especially when the parent knows the child is likely to make mistakes and suffer as a result. Yet Heavenly Father allows us to make the choices that will help us reach our divine potential! As Elder Dale&nbsp;G. Renlund taught, \u201c[His] goal in parenting is not to have His children *do* what is right; it is to have His children *choose* to do what is right and ultimately become like Him.\u201d\nNotwithstanding God\u2019s trust in us, our relationship with Him will grow only to the degree we are willing to place our trust in Him. The challenge is that we live in a fallen world and have all experienced a betrayal of trust as the result of dishonesty, manipulation, coercion, or other circumstances. Once betrayed, we may struggle to trust again. These negative trust experiences with imperfect mortals may even impact our willingness to trust in a perfect Heavenly Father.\nSeveral years ago, two friends of mine, Leonid and Valentina, expressed interest in becoming members of the Church. As Leonid began to learn the gospel, he found it difficult to pray. Earlier in his life, Leonid had suffered from manipulation and control by superiors and had developed a distrust of authority. These experiences affected his ability to open his heart and express personal feelings to Heavenly Father. With time and study, Leonid gained a better understanding of God\u2019s character and experienced feeling God\u2019s love. Eventually, prayer became a natural way for him to express thanks and the love he was feeling for God. His increasing trust in God eventually led him and Valentina to enter into sacred covenants to strengthen their relationship with God and each other.\nIf prior loss of trust is keeping you from trusting God, please follow Leonid\u2019s example. Patiently continue to learn more about Heavenly Father, His character, His attributes, and His purposes. Look for and record experiences feeling His love and power in your life. Our living prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, has taught that the more we learn about God, the easier it will be for us to trust Him.\nSometimes the best way to learn to trust God is simply by trusting Him. Like \u201cThe Crazy Trust Exercise,\u201d sometimes we just need to be willing to fall backward and let Him catch us. Our mortal life is a test. Challenges that stretch us beyond our own capacity come frequently. When our own knowledge and understanding are inadequate, we naturally look for resources to help us. In an information-saturated world, there is no shortage of sources promoting their solutions to our challenges. However, the simple, time-tested counsel in Proverbs provides the best advice: \u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart.\u201d We show our trust in God by turning to Him first when confronted with life\u2019s challenges.\nAfter I finished law school in Utah, our family faced the important decision of where to work and make our home. After counseling with each other and the Lord, we felt directed to move our family to the eastern United States, far from parents and siblings. Initially, things went well, and we felt confirmed in our decision. But then things changed. There was downsizing at the law firm, and I faced the prospect of no job or insurance at the very time our daughter Dora was born with serious medical challenges and long-term special needs. While confronting these challenges, I was extended a call to serve that would require significant time and commitment.\nI had never faced such a challenge and was overwhelmed. I began to question the decision we had made and its accompanying confirmation. We had trusted in the Lord, and things were supposed to work out. I had fallen backward, and it now appeared that no one was going to catch me.\nOne day the words \u201cDon\u2019t ask why; ask what I want you to learn\u201d came distinctly into my mind and heart. Now I was even more confused. In the very moment I was struggling with my earlier decision, God was inviting me to trust Him even more. Looking back, this was a critical point in my life\u2014it was the moment when I realized that the best way to learn to trust in God was simply by trusting Him. In the subsequent weeks, I watched with amazement as the Lord miraculously unfolded His plan to bless our family.\nGood teachers and coaches know that intellectual growth and physical strength can happen only when minds and muscles are stretched. Likewise, God invites us to grow by trusting His spiritual tutoring through soul-stretching experiences. Therefore, we can be sure that whatever trust we may have demonstrated in God in the past, another trust-stretching experience lies yet ahead. God is focused on our growth and progress. He is the Master Teacher, the complete coach who is always stretching us to help us realize more of our divine potential. That will always include a future invitation to trust Him just a little bit more.\nThe Book of Mormon teaches the pattern God uses to stretch us in order to build strong relationships with us. In Come, Follow Me, we recently studied about how Nephi\u2019s trust in God was tested when he and his brothers were commanded to return to Jerusalem to obtain the brass plates. After their initial attempts failed, his brothers gave up and were ready to return without the plates. But Nephi chose to place his complete trust in the Lord and was successful in obtaining the plates. That experience likely strengthened Nephi\u2019s confidence in God when his bow broke and the family was facing starvation in the wilderness. Again, Nephi chose to trust in God, and the family was saved. These successive experiences gave Nephi even stronger confidence in God for the enormous, trust-stretching task he would soon face of building a ship.\nThrough these experiences, Nephi strengthened his relationship with God by consistently and continuously trusting Him. God uses the same pattern with us. He extends us personal invitations to strengthen and deepen our trust in Him. Each time we accept and act on an invitation, our trust in God grows. If we ignore or decline an invitation, our progress stops until we\u2019re ready to act on a new invitation.\nThe good news is that regardless of the trust we may or may not have chosen to place in God in the past, we can choose to trust God today and every day going forward. I promise that each time we do, God will be there to catch us, and our relationship of trust will grow stronger and stronger until the day that we become one with Him and His Son. Then we can declare like Nephi, \u201cO Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "I would like to express gratitude for your prayers as I have started the process of adjusting to the call, through President Nelson, to serve as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. You can probably well imagine how humbling this has felt, and it has been a time of extraordinary upheaval and sobering self-examination. It is, however, indeed a great honour to serve the Saviour, in any capacity, and to be engaged with you in sharing the good news of His gospel of hope.\nBeyond that, it has been said that behind every new Apostle stands an astonished mother-in-law. I don\u2019t know if that has actually been said, but in this case, it certainly could be. And I suspect that the fact that my mother-in-law is no longer with us does nothing to reduce her astonishment.\nSeveral months ago, when my wife and I were visiting another country for various Church assignments, I woke up early one morning and looked blearily outside our hotel window. Down below on the busy street, I saw that a roadblock had been set up with a policeman stationed nearby to turn cars around as they reached the barrier. At first, only a few cars traveled along the road and were turned back. But as time went by and traffic increased, queues of cars began to build up.\nFrom the window above, I watched as the policeman seemed to take satisfaction in his power to block the flow of traffic and turn people away. In fact, he seemed to develop a spring in his step, as if he might start doing a little jig, as each car approached the barrier. If a driver got frustrated about the roadblock, the policeman did not appear helpful or sympathetic. He just shook his head repeatedly and pointed in the opposite direction.\nMy friends, my fellow disciples on the road of mortal life, our Father\u2019s beautiful plan, even His \u201cfabulous\u201d plan, is designed to bring you home, *not* to keep you out. No one has built a roadblock and stationed someone there to turn you around and send you away. In fact, it is the exact opposite. God is in relentless pursuit of you. He \u201cwants all of His children to choose to return to Him,\u201d and He employs every possible measure to bring you back.\nOur loving Father oversaw the Creation of this very earth for the express purpose of providing an opportunity for you and for me to have the stretching and refining experiences of mortality, the chance to use our God-given moral agency to choose Him, to learn and grow, to make mistakes, to repent, to love God and our neighbour, and to one day return home to Him.\nHe sent His precious Beloved Son to this fallen world to live the full range of the human experience, to provide an example for the rest of His children to follow, and to atone and redeem. Christ\u2019s great atoning gift removes every roadblock of physical and spiritual death that would separate us from our eternal home.\nEverything about the Father\u2019s plan for His beloved children is designed to bring everyone home.\nWhat do God\u2019s messengers, His prophets, call this plan in Restoration scripture? They call it the plan of redemption, the plan of mercy, the great plan of happiness, and the plan of salvation, which is unto all, \u201cthrough the blood of mine Only Begotten.\u201d\nThe intent of the Father\u2019s great plan of happiness is your *happiness*, right here, right now, and in the eternities. It is not to prevent your happiness and cause you instead worry and fear.\n\nThe intent of the Father\u2019s plan of redemption is in fact your *redemption*, your being rescued through the sufferings and death of Jesus Christ, freed from the captivity of sin and death. It is not to leave you as you are.\nThe intent of the Father\u2019s plan of mercy is to *extend mercy* as you turn back to Him and honour your covenant of fidelity to Him. It is not to deny mercy and inflict pain and sorrow.\nThe intent of the Father\u2019s plan of salvation is in fact your *salvation* in the celestial kingdom of glory as you receive \u201cthe testimony of Jesus\u201d and offer your whole soul to Him. It is not to keep you out.\nDoes this mean anything goes with regard to how we live our lives? That the way we choose to use our agency doesn\u2019t matter? That we can take or leave God\u2019s commandments? No, of course not. Surely one of Jesus\u2019s most consistent invitations and pleas during His mortal ministry was that we change and repent and come unto Him. Fundamentally implicit in all of His teachings to live on a higher plane of moral conduct is a call to personal progression, to transformative faith in Christ, to a mighty change of heart.\nGod wants for us a radical reorientation of our selfish and prideful impulses, the eviction of the natural man, for us to \u201cgo, and sin no more.\u201d\nIf we believe the intent of the Father\u2019s all-reaching plan is to save us, redeem us, extend mercy to us, and thereby bring us happiness, what is the intent of the Son through whom this great plan is brought about?\nThe Son tells us Himself: \u201cFor I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.\u201d\nJesus\u2019s will is the benevolent Father\u2019s will! He wants to make it possible for every last one of His Father\u2019s children to receive the end goal of the plan\u2014eternal life with Them. None is excluded from this divine potential.\nIf you are prone to worry that you will never measure up, or that the loving reach of Christ\u2019s infinite Atonement mercifully covers everyone else but not you, then you misunderstand. *Infinite* means infinite. *Infinite* covers you and those you love.\nNephi explains this beautiful truth: \u201cHe doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.\u201d\nThe Saviour, the Good Shepherd, goes in search of His lost sheep until He finds them. He is \u201cnot willing that any should perish.\u201d\n\u201cMine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive.\u201d\n\u201cHave ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you.\u201d\nHe did not cast away the woman with the issue of blood; He did not recoil from the leper; He did not reject the woman taken in adultery; He did not refuse the penitent\u2014no matter their sin. And He will not refuse you or those you love when you bring to Him your broken hearts and contrite spirits. That is *not* His intent or His design, nor His plan, purpose, wish, or hope.\nNo, He does not put up roadblocks and barriers; He removes them. He does not keep you out; He welcomes you in. His entire ministry was a living declaration of this intent.\nThen of course there is His atoning sacrifice itself, which is harder for us to understand, beyond our mortal capacity to comprehend. But, and this is an important \u201cbut,\u201d we do understand, can comprehend, the holy, saving intent of His atoning sacrifice.\nThe veil of the temple was rent in twain when Jesus died upon the cross, symbolising that access back to the presence of the Father had been ripped wide open\u2014to all who will turn to Him, trust Him, cast their burdens on Him, and take His yoke upon them in a covenant bond.\nIn other words, the Father\u2019s plan is not about roadblocks. It never was; it never will be. Are there things we need to do, commandments to keep, aspects of our natures to change? Yes. But with His grace, those are within our reach, not beyond our grasp.\nThis is the good news! I am unspeakably grateful for these simple truths. The Father\u2019s design, His plan, His purpose, His intent, His wish, and His hope are all to heal you, all to give you peace, all to bring you, and those you love, home. Of this I am a witness in the name of Jesus Christ, His Son, amen.",

May I borrow that accent for 10 minutes?\n\n\nYearned-for Miracles\n\nIn the New Testament we learn of blind Bartimaeus, who cried out to Jesus desiring a miracle. \u201cJesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And *immediately* he received his sight.\u201d\nOn another occasion a man in Bethsaida longed for healing. In contrast, this miracle *did not come instantly*. Rather, Jesus blessed him *twice* before he \u201cwas restored.\u201d\nIn a third example, the Apostle Paul \u201c*besought the Lord thrice*\u201d in his affliction, and yet, to our knowledge, *his earnest supplication was not granted*.\nThree different people. Three unique experiences.\nThus, a question: Why do some receive their yearned-for miracles quickly, while others patiently endure, waiting upon the Lord? We may not know the *why*, yet gratefully, we know He *who* \u201cloveth [us]\u201d and \u201c[doeth] all things for [our] welfare and happiness.\u201d\n\n\n\nDivine Purposes\n\nGod, who sees the end from the beginning, reassures, \u201cThine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment,\u201d and they shall be consecrated \u201cfor thy gain.\u201d\nHelping us find further meaning in our trials, Elder Orson&nbsp;F. Whitney taught: \u201cNo pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education.&nbsp;\u2026 All \u2026 that we [patiently] endure&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable.&nbsp;\u2026 It is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our [heavenly parents].\u201d\nUnderstanding that \u201cthe power of Christ [would] rest upon [him]\u201d in his afflictions, the Apostle Paul said humbly, \u201cFor when I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d\nLife\u2019s trials prove us. Even the Savior \u201clearned \u2026 obedience by\u201d and was made \u201cperfect through sufferings.\u201d\nAnd one day He will compassionately declare, \u201cBehold, I have refined *thee*, I have chosen *thee* in the furnace of affliction.\u201d\nComing to trust in God\u2019s divine purposes breathes hope into weary souls and kindles determination in seasons of anguish and heartache.\n\n\n\nDivine Perspectives\n\nYears ago, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson shared this valuable insight: \u201cAs we look at all things with eternal perspective, it will significantly lighten our load.\u201d\n\nMy wife, Jill, and I recently witnessed this truth in the faithful lives of Holly and Rick Porter, whose 12-year-old son, Trey, passed away in a tragic fire. With hands and feet severely burned in a heroic attempt to save her dear son, Holly later testified in ward sacrament meeting of the great peace and joy the Lord had poured out upon her family in their anguish, using words such as *miraculous*, *incredible*, and *amazing*.\n\nThis precious mother\u2019s unbearable grief was replaced by surpassing peace with this thought: \u201cMy hands are not the hands that save. Those hands belong to the Savior! Instead of looking at my scars as a reminder of what I was not able to do, I remember the scars my Savior bears.\u201d\nHolly\u2019s witness fulfills our prophet\u2019s promise: \u201cAs you think celestial, you will view trials and opposition in a new light.\u201d\nElder D.&nbsp;Todd Christofferson stated: \u201cI believe that the challenge of overcoming and growing from adversity appealed to us when God presented His plan of redemption in the premortal world. We should approach that challenge now knowing that our Heavenly Father will sustain us. *But it is crucial that we turn to Him.* Without God, the dark experiences of suffering and adversity tend to despondency, despair, and even bitterness.\u201d\n\n\n\nDivine Principles\n\nTo avoid the darkness of discontent and instead find greater peace, hope, and even joy during life\u2019s difficult challenges, I share three divine principles as invitations.\n**One\u2014stronger faith comes by putting Jesus Christ first.** \u201cLook unto me in every thought,\u201d He declares; \u201cdoubt not, fear not.\u201d President Nelson taught:\n\u201c[Our] eternal life is dependent upon [our] faith in [Christ] and in His Atonement.\u201d\n\u201cAs I have wrestled with the intense pain caused by my recent injury, I have felt even deeper appreciation for Jesus Christ and the incomprehensible gift of His Atonement. Think of it! The Savior suffered \u2018pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind\u2019 so that He can comfort us, heal us, [and] rescue us in times of need.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cMy injury has caused me to reflect again and again on \u2018the greatness of the Holy One of Israel.\u2019 During my healing, the Lord has manifested His divine power in peaceful and unmistakable ways.\u201d\n\u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer,\u201d our Savior encourages; \u201cI have overcome the world.\u201d\n**Two\u2014brighter hope comes by envisioning our eternal destiny.** In speaking of the power inherent in keeping \u201ca vision of our Father\u2019s incredible promised blessings \u2026 before our eyes every day,\u201d Sister Linda Reeves testified: \u201cI do not know why we have the many trials that we have, but it is my personal feeling that the reward is so great,&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;so joyful and beyond our understanding that in that day of reward, we may feel to say to our merciful, loving Father, \u2018Was that all that was required?\u2019&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;What will it matter \u2026 what we suffered here if, in the end, those trials \u2026 qualify us for eternal life \u2026 in the kingdom of God?\u201d\nPresident Nelson shared this insight: \u201cConsider the Lord\u2019s response to Joseph Smith when he pleaded for relief in Liberty Jail. The Lord taught the Prophet that his inhumane treatment would give him experience and be for his good. \u2018If thou endure it well,\u2019 the Lord promised, \u2018God shall exalt thee on high.\u2019 The Lord was teaching Joseph to think celestial and to envision an eternal reward rather than focus on the excruciating difficulties of the day.\u201d\nJoseph\u2019s change in perspective brought deepening sanctification, as reflected in this letter to a friend: \u201cAfter having been inclosed in the walls of a prison for five months it seems to me that my heart will always be more tender after this than ever it was before.&nbsp;\u2026 I think I never could have felt as I do now if I had not suffered the wrongs that I have suffered.\u201d\n**Three\u2014greater power comes by focusing on joy.** During eternity\u2019s most crucial, agonizing hours, our Savior did not shrink but partook of the bitter cup. How did He do it? We learn, \u201cFor the joy that was set before him [Christ] endured the cross,\u201d His will \u201cbeing swallowed up in the will of the Father.\u201d\n\nThis phrase \u201cswallowed up\u201d deeply moves me. My interest was heightened when I learned that in Spanish, \u201cswallowed up\u201d is translated as \u201cconsumed\u201d; in German, as \u201cdevoured\u201d; and in Chinese, as \u201cengulfed.\u201d Thus, when life\u2019s challenges are most painful and overwhelming, I remember the Lord\u2019s promise\u2014that we \u201cshould suffer no manner of afflictions, save it [be] swallowed up [consumed, devoured, and engulfed] in the joy of Christ.\u201d\nI see in so many of you this joy, which \u201c[defies]&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;mortal comprehension,\u201d even though your bitter cups have not yet been removed. Thank you for keeping your covenants and standing as witnesses for God. Thank you for reaching out to bless us all, while \u201cin [your] quiet heart is hidden sorrow that the eye can\u2019t see.\u201d For when you bring the Savior\u2019s relief to others, you will find it for yourselves, taught President Camille N. Johnson.\n\n\n\nDivine Promises\n\nNow, return with me to the sacrament meeting where we witnessed the miracle of Holly Porter\u2019s family being succored by the Lord. On the stand while pondering what I might say to offer comfort to this remarkable family and their friends, this thought came: \u201cUse the Savior\u2019s words.\u201d So I close today as I did on that Sabbath, with His words, \u201cwhich healeth the wounded soul.\u201d\n\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d\n\u201cI will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage;&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.\u201d\n\u201cI will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy Witness\n\nWith joyful reverence, I witness our Savior lives and \u201cHis promises are sure.\u201d Especially for you who are troubled or who are \u201cafflicted in any manner,\u201d I testify that our Heavenly Father hears your tearful pleadings and will always respond in perfect wisdom. \u201cMay God grant unto you,\u201d as He has done for our family in times of great need, \u201cthat your burdens may be light,\u201d even \u201cswallowed up in the joy of Christ.\u201d In the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "\u201cHow does your Church differ from others?\u201d My answer to this important question has varied as I have matured and as the Church has grown. When I was born in Utah in 1932, our Church membership was only about 700,000, clustered mostly in Utah and nearby states. At that time, we had only 7&nbsp;temples. Today the membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints numbers more than 17 million in about 170 nations. As of this April&nbsp;1, we have 189 dedicated temples in many nations and 146 more in planning and construction. I have felt to speak about the purpose of these temples and the history and role of covenants in our worship. This will supplement the inspired teachings of earlier speakers.\n\n\nI.\n\nA covenant is a commitment to fulfill certain responsibilities. Personal commitments are essential to the regulation of our individual lives and to the functioning of society. This idea is currently being challenged. A vocal minority oppose institutional authority and insist that persons should be free from any restrictions that limit their individual freedom. Yet we know from millennia of experience that persons give up some individual freedoms to gain the advantages of living in organized communities. Such relinquishments of individual freedoms are principally based on commitments or covenants, expressed or implied.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of covenant responsibilities in our society: (1)&nbsp;judges, (2)&nbsp;military, (3)&nbsp;medical personnel, and (4)&nbsp;firefighters. All of those involved in these familiar occupations make a commitment\u2014often formalized by oath or covenant\u2014to perform their assigned duties. The same is true of our full-time missionaries. Distinctive clothing or name tags are intended to signify that the wearer is under covenant and therefore has a duty to teach and serve and should be supported in that service. A related purpose is to remind the wearers of their covenant responsibilities. There is no magic in their distinctive clothing or symbols, only a needed reminder of the special responsibilities the wearers have assumed. This is also true of the symbols of the engagement and wedding rings and their role in giving notice to observers or reminding wearers of covenant responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nWhat I have said about covenants being a foundation for the regulation of individual lives applies particularly to religious covenants. The foundation and history of many religious affiliations and requirements are based on covenants. For example, the Abrahamic covenant is fundamental to several great religious traditions. It introduces the holy idea of God\u2019s covenant promises with His children. The Old Testament frequently refers to God\u2019s covenant with Abraham and his seed.\nThe first part of the Book of Mormon, which was written during the Old Testament period, clearly demonstrates the role of covenants in the Israelite history and worship. Nephi was told that the Israelite writings of that period were \u201ca record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel.\u201d The books of Nephi make frequent reference to the Abrahamic covenant and to Israel as \u201cthe covenant people of the Lord.\u201d The practice of covenanting with God or religious leaders is also recorded in the Book of Mormon writings about Nephi, Joseph in Egypt, King Benjamin, Alma, and Captain Moroni.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nWhen the time came for the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, God called a prophet, Joseph Smith. We do not know the full content of the angel Moroni\u2019s early instructions to this maturing young prophet. We do know he told Joseph that \u201cGod had a work for [him] to do\u201d and that \u201cthe fulness of the everlasting Gospel\u201d must be brought forth, including \u201cthe promises made to the fathers.\u201d We also know that the scriptures young Joseph read most intensively\u2014even before he was directed to organize a church\u2014were the many teachings about covenants he was translating in the Book of Mormon. That book is the Restoration\u2019s major source for the fulness of the gospel, including God\u2019s plan for His children, and the Book of Mormon is filled with references to covenants.\nBeing well read in the Bible, Joseph must have known of the book of Hebrews\u2019 reference to the Savior\u2019s intent to \u201cmake a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.\u201d Hebrews also refers to Jesus as \u201cthe mediator of the new covenant.\u201d Significantly, the biblical account of the Savior\u2019s mortal ministry is titled \u201cThe New Testament,\u201d a virtual synonym for \u201cThe New Covenant.\u201d\nCovenants were foundational in the Restoration of the gospel. This is evident in the earliest steps the Lord directed the Prophet to take in organizing His Church. As soon as the Book of Mormon was published, the Lord directed the organization of His restored Church, soon to be named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Revelation recorded in April 1830 directs that persons \u201cshall be received by baptism into his church\u201d after they \u201cwitness\u201d (which means solemnly testify) \u201cthat they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.\u201d\nThis same revelation directs that the Church \u201cmeet together often to partake of bread and wine [water] in the remembrance of the Lord Jesus.\u201d The importance of this ordinance is evident in the words of covenants specified for the elder or priest who officiates. He blesses the emblems of the bread for \u201cthe souls of all those who partake of it&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;, that they \u2026 witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them.\u201d\nThe central role of covenants in the newly restored Church was reaffirmed in the preface the Lord gave for the first publication of His revelations. There the Lord declares that He has called Joseph Smith because the inhabitants of the earth \u201chave strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant.\u201d This revelation further explains that His commandments are being given \u201cthat mine everlasting covenant might be established.\u201d\nToday we understand the role of covenants in the restored Church and the worship of its members. President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley gave this summary of the effect of our baptism and our weekly partaking of the sacrament: \u201cEvery member of this church who has entered the waters of baptism has become a party to a sacred covenant. Each time we partake of the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s supper, we renew that covenant.\u201d\nWe have been reminded by many speakers at this conference that President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson often refers to the plan of salvation as the \u201ccovenant path\u201d that \u201cleads us back to [God]\u201d and \u201cis all about our relationship with God.\u201d He teaches about the significance of covenants in our temple ceremonies and urges us to see the end from the beginning and to \u201cthink celestial.\u201d\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nNow I speak more of temple covenants. In fulfillment of his responsibility to restore the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Prophet Joseph Smith spent much of his final years directing the construction of a temple in Nauvoo, Illinois. Through him the Lord revealed sacred teachings, doctrine, and covenants for his successors to administer in temples. There persons who were endowed were to be taught God\u2019s plan of salvation and invited to make sacred covenants. Those who lived faithful to those covenants were promised eternal life, wherein \u201call things are theirs\u201d and they \u201cshall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.\u201d\nThe endowment ceremonies in the Nauvoo Temple were administered just before our early pioneers were expelled to begin their historic trek to the mountains in the West. We have the testimonies of many pioneers that the power they received from being bound to Christ in their endowments in the Nauvoo Temple gave them the strength to make their epic journey and establish themselves in the West.\nPersons who have been endowed in a temple are responsible to wear a temple garment, an article of clothing not visible because it is worn beneath outer clothing. It reminds endowed members of the sacred covenants they have made and the blessings they have been promised in the holy temple. To achieve those holy purposes, we are instructed to wear temple garments continuously, with the only exceptions being those obviously necessary. Because covenants do not \u201ctake a day off,\u201d to remove one\u2019s garments can be understood as a disclaimer of the covenant responsibilities and blessings to which they relate. In contrast, persons who wear their garments faithfully and keep their temple covenants continually affirm their role as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is constructing temples all over the world. Their purpose is to bless the covenant children of God with temple worship and with the sacred responsibilities and powers and unique blessings of being bound to Christ they receive by covenant.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is known as a church that emphasizes making covenants with God. Covenants are inherent in each of the ordinances of salvation and exaltation this restored Church administers. The ordinance of baptism and its associated covenants are requirements for entrance into the celestial kingdom. The ordinances and associated covenants of the temple are requirements for exaltation in the celestial kingdom, which is eternal life, \u201cthe greatest of all the gifts of God.\u201d That is the focus of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nI testify of Jesus Christ, who is the head of that Church, and invoke His blessings on all who seek to keep their sacred covenants. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "In 1832, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon received a remarkable vision concerning the eternal destiny of God\u2019s children. This revelation spoke of three heavenly kingdoms. President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks spoke about these \u201ckingdoms of glory\u201d last October, noting that \u201cthrough the triumph and the glory of the Lamb,\u201d all but a relatively few individuals are eventually redeemed into one of these kingdoms, \u201caccording to the desires manifested through their choices.\u201d God\u2019s plan of redemption constitutes a universal opportunity for all His children, whenever and wherever they may have lived on the earth.\nWhile the glory of even the least of the three kingdoms, the telestial, \u201csurpasses all understanding,\u201d our Father\u2019s hope is that we will choose\u2014and, through the grace of His Son, qualify for\u2014the highest and most glorious of these kingdoms, the celestial, where we may enjoy eternal life as \u201cjoint-heirs with Christ.\u201d President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has urged us to \u201cthink celestial,\u201d making the celestial kingdom our eternal goal and then \u201ccarefully considering where each of [our] decisions while here on earth will place [us] in the next world.\u201d\nThose in the celestial kingdom are \u201c*they who received the testimony of Jesus*, \u2026 who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.\u201d The inhabitants of the second, or terrestrial, kingdom are described as essentially good, including the \u201chonorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men.\u201d Their principal limiting trait is that they \u201c*are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus*.\u201d By contrast, those in the lower, telestial kingdom are those who \u201creceived not the gospel, *neither the testimony of Jesus*.\u201d\nNote that the distinguishing characteristic for the inhabitants of each kingdom is how they relate to \u201cthe testimony of Jesus,\u201d ranging from (1)&nbsp;wholehearted devotion to (2)&nbsp;not being valiant to (3)&nbsp;outright rejection. On each person\u2019s reaction hangs his or her eternal future.\n\n\nI.\n\nWhat is the testimony of Jesus?\nIt is the witness of the Holy Spirit that He is the divine Son of God, the Messiah and Redeemer. It is John\u2019s testimony that Jesus was in the beginning with God, that He is the Creator of heaven and earth, and that \u201cin him was the gospel, and the gospel was the life, and the life was the light of men.\u201d It is \u201cthe testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, \u2026 that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven.\u201d It is the knowledge that \u201cthere is no other name given whereby salvation cometh.\u201d It is the \u201ctestimony, last of all,\u201d given by the Prophet Joseph Smith, \u201cthat he lives! \u2026 That he is the Only Begotten of the Father\u2014that by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.\u201d\n\n\n\nII.\n\nBeyond this testimony is the question, What do we do about it?\nThe inheritors of the celestial kingdom \u201creceive\u201d the testimony of Jesus in the fullest sense by being baptized, receiving the Holy Ghost, and overcoming by faith. The principles and truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ govern their priorities and choices. The testimony of Jesus is manifest in what they are and what they are becoming. Their motive is charity, \u201cthe pure love of Christ.\u201d Their focus is on pursuing \u201cthe measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\u201d\nAt least some of those who will be found in the terrestrial kingdom also accept the testimony of Jesus, but they are distinguished by what they *don\u2019t* do about it. Not being valiant in the witness of the Savior suggests a degree of apathy or casualness\u2014being \u201clukewarm\u201d\u2014 as opposed to the people of Ammon in the Book of Mormon, for example, who were \u201cdistinguished for their zeal towards God.\u201d\nThe inhabitants of the telestial kingdom are those who reject the testimony of Jesus along with His gospel, His covenants, and His prophets. They are described by Abinadi as \u201chaving gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would not.\u201d\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nWhat does it mean to be valiant in the testimony of Jesus?\nThere are several possibilities that could be considered in answering this question. I will mention a few. Being valiant in the testimony of Jesus surely includes nurturing and strengthening that testimony. True disciples do not ignore the seemingly small things that sustain and strengthen their testimony of Jesus, such as prayer, study of the scriptures, Sabbath observance, partaking of the sacrament, repentance, ministering, and worship in the house of the Lord. President Nelson reminds us that \u201cwith frightening speed, a testimony that is not nourished daily \u2018by the good word of God\u2019 [[[Moroni 6|Moroni 6:4]]] can crumble. Thus, \u2026 we need daily experiences worshipping the Lord and studying His gospel.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI plead with you to let God prevail in your life. Give Him a fair share of your time. As you do, notice what happens to your positive spiritual momentum.\u201d\nBeing valiant also suggests being open and public about one\u2019s witness. In baptism, we confirm our willingness \u201cto stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in, even until death.\u201d In this Easter season especially, we joyfully, publicly, and unreservedly proclaim our witness of the resurrected, living Christ.\nOne aspect of being valiant in the testimony of Jesus is to heed His messengers. God does not force us into the better path, the covenant path, but He instructs His prophets to make us fully aware of the consequences of our choices. And it is not just the members of His Church. Through His prophets and apostles, He lovingly pleads with all the world to heed the truth that will make them free, spare them needless suffering, and bring them enduring joy.\nBeing valiant in the testimony of Jesus means encouraging others, by word and example, to likewise be valiant, especially those of our own families. Elder Neal&nbsp;A. Maxwell once addressed \u201cthe essentially \u2018honorable\u2019 members [of the Church] who are skimming over the surface instead of deepening their discipleship and who are casually engaged rather than \u2018anxiously engaged\u2019 [[[D&C 76|Doctrine and Covenants 76:75]]; [[D&C 58|58:27]]].\u201d Noting that all are free to choose, Elder Maxwell lamented: \u201cUnfortunately, however, when some choose slackness, they are choosing not only for themselves, but for the next generation and the next. Small equivocations in parents can produce large deviations in their children! Earlier generations in a family may have reflected dedication, while some in the current generation evidence equivocation. Sadly, in the next, some may choose dissension, as erosion takes its toll.\u201d\nYears ago, Elder John&nbsp;H. Groberg related the story of a young family living in a small branch in Hawaii in the early 1900s. They had been members of the Church for about two years when one of their daughters fell ill with an undiagnosed disease and was hospitalized. At church the next Sunday, the father and his son prepared the sacrament as they did most weeks, but as the young father knelt to bless the bread, the branch president, suddenly realizing who was at the sacrament table, jumped up and cried, \u201cStop. You can\u2019t touch the sacrament. Your daughter has an unknown disease. Leave immediately while someone else fixes new sacrament bread. We can\u2019t have you here. Go.\u201d The stunned father searchingly looked at the branch president and then the congregation and, sensing the depth of anxiety and embarrassment from all, motioned to his family, and they quietly filed out of the chapel.\nNot a word was said as, dejectedly, the family walked along the trail to their small home. There they sat in a circle, and the father said, \u201cPlease be silent until I am ready to speak.\u201d The young son wondered what they would do to get revenge for the shame they had suffered: would they kill the branch president\u2019s pigs, or burn his house, or join another church? Five, ten, fifteen, twenty-five minutes passed in silence.\nThe father\u2019s clenched fists began to relax, and tears formed. The mother began to cry, and soon each of the children was quietly weeping. The father turned to his wife and said, \u201cI love you,\u201d and then repeated those words to each of their children. \u201cI love all of you and I want us to be together, forever, as a family. And the only way that can be is for all of us to be good members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and be sealed by the holy priesthood in the temple. This is not the branch president\u2019s church. It is the Church of Jesus Christ. We will not allow any man or any hurt or embarrassment or pride to keep us from being together forever. Next Sunday we will go back to church. We will stay by ourselves until our daughter\u2019s sickness is known, but we will go back.\u201d\nThey did go back, their daughter recovered, and the family was sealed in the Laie Hawaii Temple when it was completed. Today, well over 100 souls call their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather blessed because he kept his eyes on eternity.\nOne last aspect of being valiant in the testimony of Jesus that I will mention is our individual pursuit of personal holiness. Jesus is our essential Redeemer, and He pleads, \u201cRepent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.\u201d\nThe prophet Mormon describes one group of Saints who persevered in this manner despite having \u201cto wade through much affliction\u201d:\n\u201cNevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.\u201d It is this mighty change of heart\u2014yielding our hearts to God and being spiritually reborn through the grace of the Savior\u2014that we seek.\nMy invitation is to act now to secure your place as one who is valiant in the testimony of Jesus. As repentance may be needed, \u201cdo not procrastinate the day of your repentance,\u201d lest \u201cin an hour when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended, and your souls not saved.\u201d Be zealous in keeping your covenants with God. Do not be \u201coffended [by] the strictness of the word.\u201d \u201cRemember to retain the name [of Christ] written always in your hearts, \u2026 that ye [may] hear and know *the voice* by which ye shall be called, and also, *the name* by which he shall call you.\u201d And finally, \u201csettle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which [Jesus] shall teach, and command you.\u201d\nOur Father wants all His children who will to enjoy eternal life with Him in His celestial kingdom. Jesus suffered, died, and was resurrected to make that possible. He \u201chath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right hand of God, to claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men.\u201d I pray that we may all be blessed with a burning testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, rejoice and be valiant in that testimony, and enjoy the fruits of His grace in our lives continually. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Today I would like to begin by testifying of the complete certainty within my heart that God hears our prayers and answers them in a personalized way.\nIn a world going through times of uncertainty, pain, disappointment, and heartbreak, we might feel inclined to rely more on personal abilities and preferences, as well as the knowledge and security that come from the world. This could cause us to put in the background the real source of succor and support that can counter the challenges of this mortal life.\n\nI remember an occasion when I was hospitalized for an illness, and it was difficult for me to sleep. When I turned off the lights and the room became dark, I saw a reflective sign on the ceiling in front of me that said, \u201cCall, don\u2019t fall.\u201d To my surprise, the next day I observed the same message repeated in several parts of the room.\n\nWhy was that message so important? When I asked the nurse about it, she said, \u201cIt is to prevent a blow that might increase the pain you already have.\u201d\nThis life, by its nature, brings painful experiences, some inherent to our physical bodies, some due to our weaknesses or afflictions, some due to the way others use their agency, and some due to our use of agency.\nIs there a promise more powerful than the one the Savior Himself made when He declared, \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,\u201d or call, \u201cand it shall be opened unto you\u201d?\nPrayer is the means of communication with our Heavenly Father that allows us to \u201ccall and don\u2019t fall.\u201d However, there are circumstances in which we might think that the call has not been heard because we do not receive an immediate response or one according to our expectations.\nThis sometimes leads to anxiety, sadness, or disappointment. But remember Nephi\u2019s expression of faith in the Lord when he said, \u201cHow is it that he cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship?\u201d Now, I ask you, how is it that the Lord cannot instruct you, that you do not fall?\nConfidence in God\u2019s answers implies accepting that His ways are not our ways and that \u201call things must come to pass in their time.\u201d\nThe certainty of knowing that we are children of a loving and merciful Heavenly Father should be the motivation to \u201ccall\u201d in devout prayer with an attitude of \u201cpray[ing] always, and not faint[ing]; \u2026 that [our] performance may be for the welfare of [our] soul[s].\u201d Imagine the feelings of Heavenly Father when in each prayer we make a supplication in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ. What power and tenderness, I believe, are displayed when we do so!\nThe scriptures are full of examples of those who called out to God so they would not fall. Helaman and his army, while facing their afflictions, called upon God, pouring out their souls in prayer. They received assurance, peace, faith, and hope, gaining courage and determination until they achieved their goal.\nImagine how Moses would have called and cried out to God when finding himself between the Red Sea and the Egyptians approaching to attack, or Abraham when obeying the mandate to sacrifice his son Isaac.\nI am certain that each of you have had and will have experiences where calling will be the answer to not fall.\nThirty years ago, while my wife and I were preparing for our civil marriage and our temple marriage, we received a call informing us that civil marriages were canceled due to a strike. We received the call three days before the scheduled ceremony. After several attempts at other offices and not finding available appointments, we began to feel distressed and doubtful that we really could get married as planned.\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I \u201ccalled,\u201d pouring out our souls to God in prayer. Finally, someone told us about an office in a small town on the outskirts of the city where an acquaintance was the mayor. Without hesitation, we went to visit him and asked him if it would be possible to marry us. To our joy, he agreed. His secretary emphasized to us that we had to obtain a certificate in that city and deliver all the documents before noon the next day.\nThe next day, we moved to the small town and went to the police station to request the required document. To our surprise, the officer said that he would not give it to us because many young couples had been running away from their families to get married secretly in that town, which of course was not our case. Again, fear and sadness overtook us.\nI remember how I silently called out to my Heavenly Father so as not to fall. I received a clear impression in my mind, repeatedly saying, \u201cTemple recommend, temple recommend.\u201d I immediately took out my temple recommend and handed it to the officer, to my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s bewilderment.\nWhat a surprise we had when we heard the officer say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you are from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? I know your church well.\u201d He immediately began to prepare the document. We were even more surprised when the officer left the station without saying anything.\nFifty minutes passed, and he did not return. It was already 11:55 in the morning, and we had only until noon to deliver the papers. Suddenly he appeared with a beautiful puppy and told us it was a wedding gift and gave it to us along with the document.\nWe ran toward the mayor\u2019s office with our document and our new dog. Then we saw an official vehicle coming toward us. I stopped in front of it. The vehicle stopped, and we saw the secretary inside. Seeing us, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I told you noon. I must go on another errand.\u201d\nI humbled myself in silence, calling with all my heart to my Heavenly Father, asking for help once again to \u201cnot fall.\u201d Suddenly, the miracle happened. The secretary said to us, \u201cWhat a beautiful dog you have. Where could I find one like that for my son?\u201d\n\u201cIt is for you,\u201d we immediately replied.\nThe secretary looked at us with surprise and said, \u201cOK, let\u2019s go to the office and make the arrangements.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Carol and I were married civilly, as planned, and then we were sealed in the Lima Peru Temple.\nOf course, we need to remember that calling is a matter of faith and action\u2014faith to recognize that we have a Heavenly Father who answers our prayers according to His infinite wisdom, and then action consistent with what we asked for. Praying\u2014calling\u2014can be a sign of our hope. But taking action after praying is a sign that our faith is real\u2014faith that is tested in moments of pain, fear, or disappointment.\nI suggest you consider the following:\n\n\nAlways think of the Lord as your first option for help.\n\n\nCall, don\u2019t fall. Turn to God in sincere prayer.\n\n\nAfter praying, do all you can to obtain the blessings you prayed for.\n\n\nHumble yourselves to accept the answer in His time and His way.\n\n\nDon\u2019t stop! Keep moving forward on the covenant path while you wait for an answer.\n\n\nPerhaps there is someone right now who, due to circumstances, feels like they are about to fall and would like to call like Joseph Smith did when he cried out: \u201cO God, where art thou? \u2026 How long shall thy hand be stayed?\u201d\nEven in circumstances such as these, pray with \u201cspiritual momentum,\u201d as President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught, because your prayers are always heard!\nRemember this hymn:\n\n\nEre you left your room this morning,\nDid you think to pray?\nIn the name of Christ, our Savior,\nDid you sue for loving favor\nAs a shield today?\n\n\nOh, how praying rests the weary!\nPrayer will change the night to day.\nSo, when life gets dark and dreary,\nDon\u2019t forget to pray.*9*\n\n\nAs we pray we can feel the embrace of our Heavenly Father, who sent His Only Begotten Son to relieve our burdens, because if we call out to God, I testify we will not fall. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Your devotion to the work of the Lord buoys us up and stands as a testimony to the gospel of Jesus Christ. We return home from each trip wondering if we possibly gave as much as we received.\n\n\n\nWhen traveling, we have little time for sightseeing. However, when possible, I spend a few moments in a particular passion. I have an interest in architecture and design and a special fascination with bridges. Suspension bridges amaze me. Whether it\u2019s the Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo, the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong, the Tower Bridge in London, or others I have seen, I marvel at the engineering genius built within these complicated structures. Bridges take us places we otherwise would not be able to go. (Before I continue, I note that since this message was prepared, a tragic bridge accident occurred in Baltimore. We mourn the loss of life and offer condolences to affected families.)\n\n\n\nA Magnificent Suspension Bridge\n\n\u200bRecently, a conference assignment took me to California, where I once again crossed the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, regarded as an engineering wonder of the world. This monumental structure intertwines beautiful form, functional purpose, and masterful engineering. It is a classic suspension bridge with bookend towers, supported by massive piers. The colossal, majestic weight-bearing twin towers soaring above the ocean were the first elements to be constructed. Together they shoulder the load of the sweeping main suspension cables and the vertical suspender cables, which cradle the roadway below. The extraordinary stabilizing capacity\u2014the power of the tower\u2014is the magic behind the engineering of the bridge.\n\n\n\nGolden Gate Bridge District\n\n\nEarly construction images of the bridge bear testimony of this engineering principle. Each bridge element finds weight-bearing support from the symmetrical towers, both interdependently connected one to another.\n\n\n\nGetty Images/Underwood Archives\n\n\nWhen the bridge is complete, with its two powerful towers firmly in place and piers anchored in a foundation of bedrock, it is an image of strength and beauty.\n\n\nToday I invite you to look at this stately bridge\u2014with its ascending twin towers built on a strong foundation\u2014through a gospel lens.\nIn the twilight of Jesus Christ\u2019s ministry, during what we now call Holy Week, a Pharisee who was a lawyer asked the Savior a question he knew was nearly impossible to answer: \u201cMaster, which is the great commandment in the law?\u201d The lawyer, \u201ctempting him\u201d and seeking a legalistic answer, with seemingly deceitful intent, received a genuine, sacred, divine response.\n\u201cJesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\n\u201cThis is the first and great commandment.\u201d Hearkening to our bridge analogy, the first tower!\n\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d This is the second tower!\n\u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d The remaining elements of the bridge!\nLet\u2019s examine each of the two great commandments, revealed and recited in Jesus Christ\u2019s response. As we do so, let the image of the magnificent suspension bridge resonate in your mind\u2019s eye.\n\n\n\nLove the Lord\n\nThe first, to love the Lord with all your heart, soul, and mind.\nIn this answer, Jesus Christ condenses the essence of the law embodied in the sacred teachings of the Old Testament. To love the Lord centers first on your heart\u2014your very nature. The Lord asks that you love with all your soul\u2014your entire consecrated being\u2014and finally, to love with all your mind\u2014your intelligence and intellect. Love for God is not limited or finite. It is infinite and eternal.\nFor me, the application of the first great commandment can sometimes feel abstract, even daunting. Gratefully, as I consider further words of Jesus, this commandment becomes much more graspable: \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments.\u201d This I can do. I can love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, which then leads to prayer, scripture study, and temple worship. We love the Father and the Son through the payment of tithes, keeping the Sabbath day holy, living a virtuous and chaste life, and being obedient.\nLoving the Lord is often measured in small daily deeds, footsteps on the covenant path: for young people, using social media to build up rather than tear down; leaving the party, movie, or activity where standards might be challenged; showing reverence for things sacred.\nConsider this tender example. It was fast Sunday as Vance and I knocked on the door of a small, humble home. We and other deacons in the quorum had come to expect the words \u201cPlease come in,\u201d yelled warmly in a thick German accent loud enough to hear through the door. Sister Muellar was one of several immigrant widows in the ward. She couldn\u2019t answer the door very easily, as she was legally blind. As we stepped inside the dimly lit home, she greeted us with kind questions: What are your names? How are you doing? Do you love the Lord? We answered and shared that we came to receive her fast offering. Even at our young age, her meager circumstances were readily apparent, and her faith-filled response was profoundly touching: \u201cI placed a dime on the counter earlier this morning. I am so grateful to offer my fast offering. Would you be kind enough to place it in the envelope and fill out my fast-offering receipt?\u201d Her love of the Lord lifted our faith each time we left her home.\nKing Benjamin promised remarkable power for those who follow the first great commandment. \u201cI would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments. \u2026 They are blessed in all things, \u2026 and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven \u2026 in a state of never-ending happiness.\u201d\nLoving the Lord leads to eternal happiness!\n\n\n\nLove Your Neighbor\n\nJesus then said, \u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d This is the second tower of the bridge.\nHere Jesus bridges our heavenly upward gaze, to love the Lord, with our earthly outward gaze, to love our fellow men and women. One is interdependent on the other. Love of the Lord is not complete if we neglect our neighbors. This outward love includes all of God\u2019s children without regard to gender, social class, race, sexuality, income, age, or ethnicity. We seek out those who are hurt and broken, the marginalized, for \u201call are alike unto God.\u201d We \u201csuccor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.\u201d\nConsider this example: Brother Evans was surprised when he was prompted to stop his car and knock on an unknown door of an unknown family. When a widowed mother of over 10 answered the door, their difficult circumstances and great needs became readily apparent to him. The first was simple, paint for their home, which was followed by many years of temporal and spiritual ministering to this family.\nThis thankful mother later wrote of her heaven-sent friend: \u201cYou have spent your life reaching out to the least of us. How I would love to hear the things the Lord has to say to you as He expresses His appreciation for the good you have done financially and spiritually for the people that only you and He will ever know about. Thank you for blessing us in so many ways, \u2026 for the missionaries you provided for. \u2026 I often wonder if the Lord picked on you exclusively or if you were just the one who listened.\u201d\nTo love your neighbor includes Christlike deeds of kindness and service. Can you let go of grudges, forgive enemies, welcome and minister to your neighbors, and assist the elderly? You will each be inspired as you build your tower of love for neighbor.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught: \u201cGiving help to others\u2014making a conscientious effort to care about others as much as or *more* than we care about ourselves\u2014is our joy. Especially \u2026 when it is not convenient and when it takes us out of our comfort zone. *Living* that second great commandment is the *key* to becoming a true disciple of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn Interdependency\n\nJesus further taught, \u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d This is very instructive. There is an important interdependency between loving the Lord and loving one another. For the Golden Gate Bridge to perform its designed function, both towers are equally strong and with equal power to bear the weight of the suspension cables, the roadway, and the traffic crossing the bridge. Without this engineering symmetry, the bridge could be compromised, even leading to collapse. For any suspension bridge to do what it was built to do, its towers must function together in complete harmony. Likewise, our ability to follow Jesus Christ depends upon our strength and power to live the first and second commandments with balance and equal devotion to both.\n\nThe increasing contention in the world suggests, however, that we at times fail to see or remember this. Some are so focused on keeping the commandments that they show little tolerance of those they see as less righteous. Some find it difficult to love those who are choosing to live their lives outside of the covenant or even away from any religious participation.\nAlternatively, there are those who emphasize the importance of loving others without acknowledgment that we are all accountable to God. Some refuse entirely the notion that there is such a thing as absolute truth or right and wrong and believe that the only thing required of us is complete tolerance and acceptance of the choices of others. Either of these imbalances could cause your spiritual bridge to tip or even fall.\nPresident Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks described this when he said: \u201cWe are commanded to love everyone, since Jesus\u2019s parable of the good Samaritan teaches that everyone is our neighbor. But our zeal to keep this second commandment must not cause us to forget the first, to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind.\u201d\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nSo the question for each of us is, How do we build our own bridge of faith and devotion\u2014erecting tall bridge towers of both loving God and loving our neighbors? Well, we just start. Our initial efforts might look like a plan on the back of a napkin or an early-stage blueprint of the bridge we hope to construct. It might consist of a few realistic goals to understand the Lord\u2019s gospel more or to vow to judge others less. No one is too young or too old to begin.\n\nOver time, with prayerful and thoughtful planning, rough ideas are refined. New actions become habits. Early drafts become polished blueprints. We build our personal spiritual bridge with hearts and minds devoted to Heavenly Father and His Only Begotten Son as well as to our brothers and sisters with whom we work, play, and live.\nIn the days ahead, when you pass over a majestic suspension bridge or even when you see a picture, with its soaring towers, I invite you to remember the two great commandments, described by Jesus Christ in the New Testament. May the Lord\u2019s instructions inspire us. May our hearts and minds be lifted upward to love the Lord and turned outward to love our neighbor.\nMay this strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, of which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Sister Muellar was one of several immigrant widows in the ward. She couldn\u2019t answer the door very easily, as she was legally blind. As we stepped inside the dimly lit home, she greeted us with kind questions: What are your names? How are you doing? Do you love the Lord? We answered and shared that we came to receive her fast offering. Even at our young age, her meager circumstances were readily apparent, and her faith-filled response was profoundly touching: \u201cI placed a dime on the counter earlier this morning. I am so grateful to offer my fast offering.

        "full_markdown": "Recently, while driving in a city unknown to us, I inadvertently took a wrong turn, which led my wife and me onto an express highway for endless miles without being able to turn around again. We had received a kind invitation to a friend\u2019s home and worried that we would now arrive much later than we were expected to.\nWhile on this highway and desperately looking for a way out again, I blamed myself for not paying better attention to the navigation system. This experience caused me to think about how in our lives we sometimes make wrong decisions and how we must live with the consequences humbly and patiently until we are able to change our course again.\nLife is all about making choices. Our Father in Heaven gave us the divine gift of agency precisely so that we could learn from our choices\u2014from the right ones and also from the wrong ones. We correct our wrong choices when we repent. This is where growth happens. Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for all of us is about learning, developing, and progressing toward eternal life.\nEver since my wife and I were taught by the missionaries and joined the Church many years ago, I have always been impressed by the profound teachings that Lehi gave to his son Jacob in the Book of Mormon. He taught him that \u201cthe Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself\u201d and that \u201cit must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.\u201d To be able to exercise our agency, we need to have opposing options to consider. In doing so, the Book of Mormon also reminds us that we have been \u201cinstructed sufficiently\u201d and that \u201cthe Spirit of Christ\u201d has been given to every one of us to \u201cknow good from evil.\u201d\nIn life, we constantly confront many important choices. For example:\n\n\nChoosing whether or not we will follow God\u2019s commandments.\n\n\nChoosing to have faith and recognize when miracles happen or to skeptically wait for something to happen before choosing to believe only then.\n\n\nChoosing to develop trust in God or to fearfully anticipate another challenge the next day.\n\n\nAs when I took a wrong turn on that highway, suffering from the consequences of *our own* poor decisions can often be especially painful because we only have ourselves to blame. Nevertheless, we can always choose to receive comfort through the divine process of repentance, make wrong things right again, and in doing so learn some life-changing lessons.\nSometimes we can also experience opposition and trials from things outside of our control, such as:\n\n\nMoments of health and periods of sickness.\n\n\nTimes of peace and times of war.\n\n\nHours of day and of night and seasons of summer and of winter.\n\n\nTimes of labor followed by times of rest.\n\n\nEven though we usually cannot choose between these kinds of situations because they just happen, we are still free to choose *how* to react to them. We can do so with a positive or with a pessimistic attitude. We can seek to learn from the experience and ask for our Lord\u2019s help and support, or we can think that we are on our own in this trial and that we must suffer it alone. We can \u201cadjust our sails\u201d to the new reality, or we can decide not to change anything. In the darkness of night, we can turn on our lights. In the cold of winter, we should choose to wear warm clothes. In seasons of sickness, we can seek medical and spiritual help. We choose how to react to these circumstances.\n*Adjust*, *learn*, *seek*, *choose* are all action verbs. Remember that we are agents and not objects. Let us never forget that Jesus promised to \u201ctake upon him the pains and sicknesses of his people \u2026 that he may \u2026 succor,\u201d or help, us as we turn to Him. We can choose to build our foundation on the rock that is Jesus Christ so that when the whirlwind comes, \u201cit shall have no power over [us].\u201d He has promised that \u201cwhosoever will come [to Him], him will [He] receive; and blessed are those who come unto [Him].\u201d\nNow, there is one additional principle that is especially important. Lehi said that there \u201cmust needs be \u2026 an opposition *in all things*.\u201d This means that opposites don\u2019t exist apart from each other. They can even complement each other. We would not be able to identify joy unless we had also experienced sorrow at some point. Feeling hungry at times helps us to be especially grateful when we do have enough to eat again. We would not be able to identify truth unless we had also seen lies here and there.\nThese opposites are all like the two sides of one same coin. Both sides are always present. Charles Dickens provided an example of this idea when he wrote that \u201cit was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\u201d\nLet me give an example from our own life. Getting married, forming a family, and having children brought to us the greatest moments of joy we have ever experienced in our lives but also the most profound moments of pain, anguish, and grief when something happened to any one of us. Infinite joy and bliss with our children were sometimes also followed by recurring periods of sicknesses, hospitalizations, and sleepless nights filled with distress, as well as finding relief in prayers and priesthood blessings. These contrasting experiences taught us that we are never alone in moments of suffering, and they also showed us how much we can carry with the Lord\u2019s succor and help. These experiences helped to shape us in wonderful ways, and it has all been totally worthwhile. Is this not what we came here for?\nIn the scriptures we also find some interesting examples:\n\n\nLehi taught his son Jacob that the afflictions he suffered in the wilderness helped him know the greatness of God and that \u201c[God] shall consecrate [his] afflictions for [his] gain.\u201d\n\n\nDuring Joseph Smith\u2019s cruel incarceration in Liberty Jail, the Lord told him that \u201call these things shall give [him] experience, and shall be for [his] good.\u201d\n\n\nFinally, Jesus Christ\u2019s infinite sacrifice was certainly the greatest example of pain and suffering ever seen, but it also brought about the wonderful blessings of His Atonement to all of God\u2019s children.\n\n\nWhere there is sunshine, shadows must be there too. Floods can bring destruction, but they usually bring life as well. Tears of grief often turn into tears of relief and happiness. Feelings of sadness when loved ones depart are later compensated with the joy of meeting again. In periods of war and destruction, many little acts of kindness and love are also happening for those with \u201ceyes to see, and ears to hear.\u201d\nOur world today is often characterized by fear and anxiety\u2014fear of what the future might bring for us. But Jesus has taught us to trust and \u201clook unto [Him] in every thought; doubt not, fear not.\u201d\nLet us constantly make a very conscious effort to see both sides of *every* coin allotted to us in our lives. Even though both sides might sometimes not be immediately visible to us, we can know and trust that they are always there.\nWe can rest assured that our difficulties, sorrows, afflictions, and pains do not define us; rather, it is *how* we go about them that will help us grow and draw closer to God. It is our attitudes and choices that define us much better than our challenges.\nWhen in health, cherish and be grateful for it every moment. When in sickness, seek to patiently learn from it and know that this can change again according to God\u2019s will. When in sorrow, trust that happiness is around the corner; we often just cannot see it yet. Consciously shift your focus and elevate your thoughts to the positive aspects of challenges, because they are undoubtedly always there too! Never forget to be grateful. Choose to believe. Choose to have faith in Jesus Christ. Choose to always trust God. Choose to \u201cthink celestial,\u201d as President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson recently taught us!\nLet us always be mindful of our Heavenly Father\u2019s wonderful plan for us. He loves us and sent His Beloved Son to help in our trials and to open for us the door to return to Him. Jesus Christ lives and stands there at every moment, waiting for us to choose to call upon Him to provide succor, strength, and salvation. Of these things I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

From Kinshasa to Zollikofen to Fukuoka to Oakland, the youth, of their own initiative, are overflowing temple baptistries. In the past, most beloved ordinance workers had graying hair\u2014but not anymore. Called missionaries, service missionaries, and returned missionaries are around every corner. Across the world, there is a growing feeling drawing us to the house of the Lord.\nJust over a year ago, a dear family friend, age 95, living on the east coast of the United States, who had been taught by missionaries for 70 years, said to her daughter, \u201cI want to go to the temple with you.\u201d\nHer daughter replied, \u201cWell, Mother, you first need to be baptized.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d she replied, \u201cthen I want to be baptized.\u201d She was baptized. A few days later, she reverently entered the temple baptistry. And just over a month ago, she received her own endowment and sealing. \u201cThe knowledge and power of God are expanding; the veil o\u2019er the earth is beginning to burst.\u201d\n\nHave you wondered why the Lord would direct His prophet to now dot the earth with His holy temples? Why would He, at this specific time, give the needed prosperity to His covenant people that through their sacred tithes, hundreds of houses of the Lord could be built?\nThis morning, President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks showed a beautiful visual of the temples being constructed across the world. Kathy and I were recently in the Philippines. Think of this miracle: The Manila Temple was dedicated in 1984. It would be 26 years before the second temple, in Cebu City, was completed in 2010. Now, 14 years later, 11 temples are being constructed, designed, or prepared for dedication. From the north to the south: Laoag, Tuguegarao, Santiago, Urdaneta, Alabang, Naga, Tacloban City, Iloilo, Bacolod, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao. It is breathtaking to see the wondrous works of God!\n\nAcross the globe, houses of the Lord are coming closer to us. Why in our day?\n\n\nThe Last Days\n\nThe Lord warned that in the last days, there would be distress among nations, people would \u201cbe lovers of their own selves,\u201d \u201call things [would] be in commotion,\u201d confusion would abound, and \u201cmen\u2019s hearts [would] fail them.\u201d We have certainly seen men\u2019s and women\u2019s hearts fail them: the enticements of the world, the distraction of alluring voices, the neglect of spiritual nourishment, the fatigue from the demands of discipleship. Perhaps you have been saddened as you have seen someone you love, who at one time spoke sincerely of his or her faith in Jesus Christ, bore witness of the Book of Mormon, and eagerly helped build the kingdom of God, suddenly move away, at least for now, from his or her beliefs and toward the sidelines of the Church. My counsel to you is don\u2019t despair! All is well. For with God, nothing is impossible.\nWith this prophesied commotion and disbelief in the world, the Lord promised that there would be a covenant people, a people eagerly awaiting His return, a people who stand in holy settings and are not moved out of their place. He spoke of a righteous people resisting the deceptions of the adversary, disciplining their faith, thinking celestial, and trusting completely in the Savior Jesus Christ.\nWhy is the Lord now bringing hundreds of His temples closer to us? One reason is that amid the turmoil and temptations of the world, He has promised to strengthen and bless His covenant Saints, and His promises are being fulfilled!\n\n\n\nPromises from the Kirtland Temple\n\nHow do these holy houses strengthen, comfort, and protect us? We find an answer in the pleadings of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the dedication of the Kirtland Temple. It was in this temple where the Saints sang, \u201cWe\u2019ll sing and we\u2019ll shout with the armies of heaven.\u201d The Savior Himself appeared, and prophets of old returned, bestowing additional priesthood keys to the restored gospel.\nOn that sacred occasion in the Kirtland Temple, the Prophet prayed that in the Lord\u2019s holy house, the Saints would be armed with the power of God, that the name of Jesus Christ would be upon them, that His angels would have charge over them, and that they would grow up in the Lord and \u201creceive a fulness of the Holy Ghost.\u201d These powerful supplications are fulfilled in our lives as we faithfully worship in the house of the Lord.\n\n\n\nArmed with Power\n\nIn His house, we are literally endowed with heavenly power. Our faith in Jesus Christ and our love for Him are confirmed and fortified. We are spiritually assured of our true identity and the purposes of life. As we are faithful, we are blessed with protection from temptations and distractions. We feel our Savior\u2019s love as He lifts us from our difficulties and sorrows. We are armed with the power of God.\n\n\n\nHis Name upon Us\n\nIn His holy house, we take His name more completely upon us. When we are baptized, we profess our belief in Him and our willingness to keep His commandments. In the temple, we sacredly promise, through our covenants, to follow Him forever.\n\nThe youth of this Church are incredible. In a difficult world, they take upon themselves the name of Christ. In Heber City, Utah, a public meeting was held to discuss the details of a temple planned for construction. Three hundred youth filled the adjoining park to show their support for the proposed temple. One young man, speaking to government leaders in an open forum, courageously explained, \u201cI am hoping to be married in this temple. [The temple will help] me to keep myself clean and pure.\u201d Another described the temple as a symbol of light and hope. Young men and women of the Church throughout the world are embracing the name of Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\nAngels with Us\n\nIn the Kirtland Temple, the Prophet Joseph prayed that \u201cangels [would] have charge over [His Saints].\u201d Regularly performing ordinances for our ancestors in the temple brings a sweet and sure confirmation that life continues beyond the veil.\nAlthough many of our experiences in the house of the Lord are too sacred to share publicly, some we can share. Forty years ago, while living in Florida, Kathy and I traveled to the temple in Atlanta, Georgia. On Wednesday night, May&nbsp;9, 1984, as we completed a session in the temple, an ordinance worker approached me and asked if I had time to do just one preparatory initiatory ordinance. The name of the person I represented was unusual. His name was Eleazer Cercy.\nThe next day, the temple was full of Saints. As I prepared to perform my second endowment of the day, I was given the name of the person I would represent. Surprisingly, the name was the same individual from the night before, Eleazer Cercy. I felt the Spirit of the Lord as the endowment was completed. Later in the afternoon, still in the temple, Kathy saw an elderly family friend, Sister Dolly Fernandez, who now lived in Atlanta. With no male members of her family with her, she asked if I could possibly assist in the sealing of her father to her father\u2019s parents. I was of course honored.\nAs I knelt at the end of the altar for this sacred ordinance, I heard once again the name that was now inscribed in my mind, her father, Eleazer Cercy. I fully believe that following this life, I will meet and embrace a man known in his mortal life as Eleazer Cercy.\nMost of our experiences in the house of the Lord bring joyful peace and quiet revelation more than dramatic intervention. But be assured: angels do have charge over us!\n\n\n\nA Fulness of the Holy Ghost\n\nThe gift of the Holy Ghost is given to us as we are confirmed a member of the Church. Each week as we worthily partake of the bread and water in remembrance of our Savior, we are promised His Spirit will always be with us. As we come with willing hearts to the house of the Lord, the most holy place on earth, we grow up in the Lord and can \u201creceive a fulness of the Holy Ghost.\u201d Through the power of the Holy Ghost, we are filled with peace and joy and unspeakable hope. We receive the strength to remain His disciples even when we find ourselves outside of holy places.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has declared: \u201cOur Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, will perform some of His mightiest works between now and when He comes again. We will see miraculous indications that God the Father and&nbsp;\u2026 Jesus Christ&nbsp;\u2026 preside over this Church in majesty and glory.\u201d Dotting the earth with houses of the Lord is a mighty work and miraculous indication.\nMy beloved friends, if we are able and have not already increased our attendance at the temple, let us regularly find more time to worship in the house of the Lord. Let us pray for the temples that have been announced, that properties can be purchased, that governments will approve plans, that talented workers will see their gifts magnified, and that the sacred dedications will bring the approval of heaven and the visit of angels.\n\n\n\nPromises\n\nThe temple is literally the house of the Lord. I promise you as you come worthily and prayerfully to His holy house, you will be armed with His power, His name will be upon you, His angels will have charge over you, and you will grow up in the blessing of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Lord promised, \u201cEvery soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.\u201d There are many different ways to see the face of Christ, and there is no better place than in His holy house.\n\nIn this day of confusion and commotion, I testify that the temple is His holy house and will help preserve us, protect us, and prepare us for the glorious day when, with all His holy angels, our Savior returns in majesty, power, and great glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Your daily connection with God and His word has profound consequences. \u201cYe are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.\u201d\nReading the Savior\u2019s teachings in the scriptures helps us transform our homes into sanctuaries of faith and centers of gospel learning. It invites the Spirit into our homes. The Holy Ghost fills our souls with joy and converts us into lifelong disciples of Jesus Christ.\nOver these last several years, while reading the books of holy scripture, we have observed the panorama of God\u2019s teachings to His children in all the major gospel dispensations.\nIn every dispensation, we have seen a familiar pattern. God restores or reveals the gospel of Jesus Christ through His prophets. The people follow the prophets and are greatly blessed. However, over time, some people stop heeding the words of the prophets and distance themselves from the Lord and His gospel. This is what we call apostasy. The gospel was first revealed to Adam, but some of the children of Adam and Eve turned away from the Lord in apostasy. We see a pattern of restoration and apostasy repeated in the dispensations of Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and others.\nNow, today, we live in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This is the only dispensation that will not end in an apostasy. It is this dispensation that will usher in the Second Coming of the Savior Jesus Christ and His millennial reign.\nSo, what\u2019s different about this dispensation? What has the Lord provided us today, especially for our time, that will help us draw near to the Savior and never leave Him?\nOne answer that comes to my mind is the scriptures\u2014and particularly the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.\nWhile God has promised there will never be another *general* apostasy, we need to be mindful and careful to avoid a *personal* apostasy\u2014remembering, as President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught, \u201cWe are each responsible for our individual spiritual growth.\u201d Studying the Book of Mormon, as we are doing this year, always brings us closer to the Savior\u2014and helps us stay close to Him.\nWe call it \u201cstudy,\u201d and that\u2019s good because it implies effort. But we don\u2019t always need to learn some new fact. Sometimes reading the Book of Mormon is just about feeling connected to God today\u2014nourishing the soul, being strengthened spiritually before heading out to face the world, or finding healing *after* a rough day out in the world.\nWe study the scriptures so the Holy Ghost, the great teacher, can deepen our conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and help us become more like Them.\nWith these thoughts in mind, we could consider, \u201cWhat has the Holy Ghost taught us this week during our study of the Book of Mormon?\u201d and \u201cHow does this bring us closer to the Savior?\u201d\nThese are good questions for our scripture study at home. They are also excellent questions to start a Sunday class at church. We improve our teaching at church on Sunday by improving our learning at home during the week. Thus, in our Sunday classes, \u201che that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together.\u201d\nHere are a few verses the Spirit has impressed upon my mind from this week\u2019s Book of Mormon study:\n\n\nNephi instructed Jacob to \u201cpreserve these plates and hand them down \u2026 from generation to generation. And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation \u2026&nbsp;, or prophesying,\u201d Jacob should \u201cengraven \u2026 them upon these plates \u2026 for the sake of [their] people.\u201d\n\n\nJacob later testified, \u201cWe search the [scriptures], \u2026 and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken.\u201d\n\n\nNow, these verses caused me to remember what Nephi had said previously about the brass plates:\n\u201cWe had obtained the records \u2026 and searched them and found that they were \u2026 of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.\n\u201cWherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise.\u201d\n\nNow, if it was wisdom for Lehi and his family to have the scriptures, it is just as wise for us today. The great worth and spiritual power of the scriptures continue undimmed in our lives today.\nThere has never been a people in history with the access to the Book of Mormon and other scriptures that we enjoy today. Yes, Lehi and his family were blessed to carry the brass plates with them, but they didn\u2019t have a copy for every tent! The most important copy of the Book of Mormon is our personal copy. It is the copy that we read.\nIn Lehi\u2019s vision of the tree of life, Lehi taught us the importance of personal experience with the love of God. After he partook of the fruit, Lehi saw his wife, Sariah, and his sons Nephi and Sam a little way off.\n\u201cThey stood as if they knew not whither they should go.\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;I beckoned unto them,\u201d Lehi said, \u201cand I also did say unto them with a *loud voice* that they should come unto me, and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit.\n\u201cAnd \u2026 they did come unto me and partake of the fruit.\u201d\nI love Lehi\u2019s example of intentional parenting. Sariah, Nephi, and Sam were living good, righteous lives. But the Lord had something better, something sweeter for them. They didn\u2019t know where to find it, but Lehi did. So he called to them \u201cwith a loud voice\u201d to come to the tree of life and partake of the fruit for themselves. His direction was clear. There could be no misunderstanding.\nI am the product of a similar kind of intentional parenting. When I was a young boy, maybe 11 or 12 years old, my mother asked me, \u201cMark, do you know for yourself, by the Holy Ghost, that the gospel is true?\u201d\nHer question surprised me. I had always tried to be a \u201cgood boy,\u201d and I thought that was enough. But my mother, like Lehi, knew that something more was needed. I needed to act and know for myself.\nI replied that I had not yet had that experience. And she didn\u2019t seem surprised at all by my answer.\nShe then said something I have never forgotten. I remember her words to this day: \u201cHeavenly Father wants you to know for yourself. But you must put in the effort. You need to read the Book of Mormon and pray to know by the Holy Ghost. Heavenly Father will answer your prayers.\u201d\nWell, I had never read the Book of Mormon before. I didn\u2019t think I was old enough to do that. But my mother knew better.\nHer question ignited in me a desire to know for myself.\nSo, each night, in the bedroom I shared with two of my brothers, I turned on the light above my bed and read a chapter in the Book of Mormon. Then, turning off the light, I slipped out of my bed onto my knees and prayed. I prayed more sincerely and with greater desire than I ever had before. I asked Heavenly Father to please let me know of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.\nFrom the time I started reading the Book of Mormon, I felt that Heavenly Father was aware of my efforts. And I felt that I mattered to Him. As I read and prayed, comfortable, peaceful feelings rested upon me. Chapter by chapter, the light of faith was growing brighter inside my soul. In time, I realized that these feelings were confirmations of truth from the Holy Ghost. I came to know for myself that the Book of Mormon is true and that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world. How grateful I am for my mother\u2019s inspired invitation.\nThis experience reading the Book of Mormon as a boy started a pattern of scripture study that continues to bless me to this day. I still read the Book of Mormon and kneel in prayer. And the Holy Ghost confirms its truths over and over again.\nNephi said it right. It was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry the scriptures with us throughout our lives. The Book of Mormon is the \u201ckeystone\u201d that makes this dispensation different from all previous dispensations. As we study the Book of Mormon and follow the living prophet, there will be no personal apostasy in our lives.\nThe invitation to come to the tree of life by holding fast to the word of God is not just an invitation from Lehi to his family, and it is not just an invitation from my mother for me to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. It is also an invitation from our prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, to each one of us.\n\u201cI promise,\u201d he said, \u201cthat as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon *every day*, you will make better decisions\u2014*every day*. I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life.\u201d\nIt is my prayer that reading the Book of Mormon this year will be a joy and a blessing for each of us and will draw us ever nearer to the Savior.\nHeavenly Father lives. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. The Book of Mormon contains His words and conveys His love. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson is the Lord\u2019s living prophet on the earth today. I know these things to be true because of the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost, which witness I first received while reading the Book of Mormon as a boy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "My dear brothers and sisters, today is an historic day for President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks and me. It was 40&nbsp;years ago, on April&nbsp;7, 1984, when we were sustained to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We have rejoiced in each and every general conference since then, including this one. We have once again been blessed with a sacred outpouring of the Spirit. I hope you will repeatedly study the messages of this conference throughout the coming months.\nWhen I was born, there were six functioning temples in the Church\u2014one each in St. George, Logan, Manti, and Salt Lake City, Utah; as well as in Cardston, Alberta, Canada; and Laie, Hawaii. Two earlier temples had functioned briefly in Kirtland, Ohio, and Nauvoo, Illinois. As the body of the Church moved west, the Saints were forced to leave those two temples behind.\nThe Nauvoo Temple was destroyed by an arsonist\u2019s fire. It was rebuilt and then dedicated by President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley. The Kirtland Temple was desecrated by enemies of the Church. Later the Kirtland Temple was acquired by Community of Christ, which has owned it for many years.\nLast month we announced that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has purchased the Kirtland Temple, along with several significant historic sites in Nauvoo. We greatly appreciate the cordial and mutually beneficial discussions we had with leaders from Community of Christ that led to this agreement.\n\nThe Kirtland Temple has unusual significance in the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Several events that took place there had been prophesied for millennia and were essential for the Lord\u2019s restored Church to fulfill its latter-day mission.\nThe most important of these events occurred on Easter Sunday, April&nbsp;3, 1836. On that day, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery experienced a *series* of remarkable visitations. First, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared. The Prophet recorded that the Savior\u2019s \u201ceyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters.\u201d\nDuring this visitation, the Lord affirmed His identity. He said, \u201cI am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father.\u201d\nJesus Christ then declared that He had accepted the temple as *His* house and made this stunning promise: \u201cI will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house.\u201d\nThis significant promise applies to *every* dedicated temple today. I invite you to ponder what the Lord\u2019s promise means for you personally.\nFollowing the Savior\u2019s visitation, Moses appeared. Moses conferred upon Joseph Smith the keys for the gathering of Israel and the return of the ten tribes.\nWhen this vision closed, \u201cElias appeared, and committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham\u201d to Joseph.\nThen Elijah the prophet appeared. His appearance fulfilled Malachi\u2019s promise that before the Second Coming, the Lord would send Elijah to \u201cturn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers.\u201d Elijah conferred the keys of the sealing power upon Joseph Smith.\nThe significance of these keys being returned to the earth by three heavenly messengers under the direction of the Lord cannot be overstated. Priesthood keys constitute the authority and power of presidency. Priesthood keys govern how the priesthood of God may be used to bring about the Lord\u2019s purposes and bless all who accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.\nIt is important to note that prior to the organization of the Church, heavenly messengers had conferred the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods upon the Prophet Joseph and had given him keys of both priesthoods. These keys gave Joseph Smith authority to organize the Church in 1830.\nThen in the Kirtland Temple in 1836, the conferral of these three additional priesthood keys\u2014namely, keys of the gathering of Israel, keys of the gospel of Abraham, and keys of the sealing power\u2014was essential. These keys authorized Joseph Smith\u2014and all succeeding Presidents of the Lord\u2019s Church\u2014to gather Israel on both sides of the veil, to bless all covenant children with the blessings of Abraham, to place a ratifying seal on priesthood ordinances and covenants, and to seal families eternally. The power of these priesthood keys is infinite and breathtaking.\nConsider how *your* life would be different if priesthood keys had not been restored to the earth. Without priesthood keys, you could not be endowed with the power of God. Without priesthood keys, the Church could serve only as a significant teaching and humanitarian organization but not much more. Without priesthood keys, none of us would have access to essential ordinances and covenants that bind us to our loved ones eternally and allow us eventually to live with God.\nPriesthood keys distinguish The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from any other organization on earth. Many other organizations *can* and *do* make your life better here in mortality. But no other organization *can* and *will* influence your life after death.\nPriesthood keys give us the authority to extend all of the blessings promised to Abraham to every covenant-keeping man and woman. Temple work makes these exquisite blessings available to *all* of God\u2019s children, regardless of *where* or *when* they lived or now live. Let us rejoice that priesthood keys are once again on the earth!\nI invite you to consider carefully the following three statements:\n\n\nThe gathering of Israel is evidence that God loves *all* of His children everywhere.\n\n\nThe gospel of Abraham is *further* evidence that God loves *all* of His children everywhere. He invites *all* to come unto Him\u2014\u201cblack and white, bond and free, male and female; \u2026 *all* are alike unto God.\u201d\n\n\nThe sealing power is *supernal* evidence of how much God loves *all* of His children everywhere and wants *each* of them to choose to return home to Him.\n\n\nPriesthood keys restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith make it possible for *every* covenant-keeping man and woman to enjoy incredible *personal* spiritual privileges. Here again, there is much we can learn from the sacred history of the Kirtland Temple.\nJoseph Smith\u2019s dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple is a tutorial about how the temple spiritually empowers you and me to meet the challenges of life in these last days. I encourage you to study that prayer, recorded in [[D&C 109|Doctrine and Covenants section&nbsp;109]]. That dedicatory prayer, which was *received by revelation*, teaches that the temple is \u201ca house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.\u201d\nThis list of attributes is much more than a description of a temple. It is a promise about what will happen to those who serve and worship in the house of the Lord. They can *expect* to receive answers to prayer, personal revelation, greater faith, strength, comfort, increased knowledge, and increased power.\nTime in the temple will help you to *think celestial* and to catch a vision of who you really are, who you can become, and the kind of life you can have forever. Regular temple worship will enhance the way you see yourself and how you fit into God\u2019s magnificent plan. I promise you that.\nWe are also promised that in the temple we may \u201creceive a fulness of the Holy Ghost.\u201d Imagine what *that* promise means in terms of having the heavens open for each earnest seeker of eternal truth.\nWe are instructed that all who worship in the temple will have the power of God and angels having \u201ccharge over them.\u201d How much does it increase your confidence to know that, as an endowed woman or man armed with the power of God, you do not have to face life alone? What courage does it give you to know that angels really will help you?\nFinally, we are promised that \u201cno combination of wickedness\u201d will prevail over those who worship in the house of the Lord.\nUnderstanding the spiritual privileges made possible in the temple is vital to each of us today.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, here is my promise. Nothing will help you *more* to hold fast to the iron rod than worshipping in the temple as regularly as your circumstances permit. Nothing will protect you *more* as you encounter the world\u2019s mists of darkness. Nothing will bolster your testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement or help you understand God\u2019s magnificent plan *more*. Nothing will soothe your spirit *more* during times of pain. Nothing will open the heavens *more*. Nothing!\nThe temple *is* the gateway to the greatest blessings God has in store for each of us, for the temple is the only place on earth where we may receive *all* of the blessings promised to Abraham. That is why we are doing all within our power, under the direction of the Lord, to make the temple blessings more accessible to members of the Church. Thus, we are pleased to announce that we plan to build a new temple in each of the following 15&nbsp;locations:\n\n\nUturoa, French Polynesia\n\n\nChihuahua, Mexico\n\n\nFlorian\u00f3polis, Brazil\n\n\nRosario, Argentina\n\n\nEdinburgh, Scotland\n\n\nBrisbane, Australia south area\n\n\nVictoria, British Columbia\n\n\nYuma, Arizona\n\n\nHouston, Texas south area\n\n\nDes Moines, Iowa\n\n\nCincinnati, Ohio\n\n\nHonolulu, Hawaii\n\n\nWest Jordan, Utah\n\n\nLehi, Utah\n\n\nMaracaibo, Venezuela\n\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, I testify that this *is* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He stands at its head. We are His disciples.\nLet us *rejoice* in the restoration of priesthood keys, which make it possible for you and me to enjoy *every* spiritual blessing we are *willing* and worthy to receive. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",
