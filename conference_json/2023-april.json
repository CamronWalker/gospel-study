        "full_markdown": "First Presidency Letter on Easter\n\n\u200bYou likely remember hearing a letter from the First Presidency read in your ward or branch several weeks ago. That letter announced that next Sunday\u2014Easter Sunday\u2014all wards and branches are to meet for sacrament meeting only, leaving additional time for worship at home as families to commemorate this most important holiday.\nThe First Presidency\u2019s letter caught my attention, and it caused me to reflect on the way our family has celebrated Easter through the years. The more I thought about our celebrations, the more I found myself wondering if we are inadvertently shortchanging the true meaning of this holiday, so central to all believers in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nChristmas and Easter Traditions\n\n\u200bThose thoughts led me to ponder the difference between the way we have celebrated Christmas as compared with Easter. During December, we somehow manage to incorporate the fun of \u201cJingle Bells,\u201d Christmas stockings, and gifts alongside other, more thoughtful traditions\u2014such as caring for those in need, singing our favorite Christmas carols and hymns, and of course opening the scriptures and reading the Christmas story in [[Luke 2|Luke&nbsp;2]]. Every year as we read this beloved story from a large old Bible, our family does what your family probably does\u2014dressed with towels on our heads and shoulders and donning bathrobes to represent Joseph, Mary, and the many who came to worship the baby Jesus, we reenact the treasured Christmas story of the Savior\u2019s birth.\n\u200bOur family celebrations at Easter, however, have been somewhat different. I feel our family has relied more on \u201cgoing to church\u201d to provide the meaningful, Christ-centered part of Easter; and then, as a family, we have gathered to share in other Easter-related traditions. I have loved watching our children and now our grandchildren hunt for Easter eggs and dig through their Easter baskets.\nBut the First Presidency letter was a wake-up call. Not only did they invite all of us to make sure our celebration of the most important event to ever happen on this earth\u2014the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ\u2014includes the reverence and respect the Lord deserves, but they also gave us more time with our families and friends on Easter Sunday to do so.\n\nThese words of the Prophet Joseph Smith add additional context to the significance of the events surrounding Easter: \u201cThe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and *all other things* which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.\u201d\nLesa and I have discussed ways that our family can do better during the Easter season. Perhaps the question we have asked ourselves is one we could all contemplate: How do we model the teaching and celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Easter story, with the same balance, fulness, and rich religious tradition of the birth of Jesus Christ, the Christmas story?\nIt seems we are all trying. I observe a growing effort among Latter-day Saints toward a more Christ-centered Easter. This includes a greater and more thoughtful recognition of Palm Sunday and Good Friday as practiced by some of our Christian cousins. We might also adopt appropriate Christ-centered Easter traditions found in the cultures and practices of countries worldwide.\nNew Testament scholar N.&nbsp;T. Wright suggested: \u201cWe should be taking steps to celebrate Easter in creative new ways: in art, literature, children\u2019s games, poetry, music, dance, festivals, bells, special concerts. \u2026 This is our greatest festival. Take Christmas away, and in biblical terms you lose two chapters at the front of Matthew and Luke, nothing else. Take Easter away, and you don\u2019t have a New Testament; you don\u2019t have a Christianity.\u201d\n\n\n\nEaster, the Bible, and the Book of Mormon\n\n\u200bWe cherish the Bible for all it teaches us about the birth, ministry, Crucifixion, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. No three words embody more hope and eternal consequence for all of humankind than those uttered by a heavenly angel on Easter morning at the Garden Tomb: \u201cHe is risen.\u201d We are deeply grateful for New Testament scripture that preserves the story of Easter and the Savior\u2019s Easter ministry in Judea and Galilee.\nAs Lesa and I continued to ponder and seek ways to expand our family Easter celebration to be more Christ-centered, we discussed what scripture reading tradition we might introduce to our family\u2014the [[Luke 2|Luke 2]] equivalent for Easter, if you will.\nAnd then we had this heavenly epiphany: In addition to the important verses about Easter in the New Testament, we as Latter-day Saints are endowed with a most remarkable Easter gift! A gift of unique witness, another testament of the Easter miracle that contains perhaps the most magnificent Easter scriptures in all of Christianity. I am referring of course to the Book of Mormon and, more specifically, to the account of Jesus Christ appearing to inhabitants in the New World in His resurrected glory.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith described the Book of Mormon as \u201cthe most correct of any book,\u201d and beginning with [[3 Nephi 11|3&nbsp;Nephi 11]], it tells the magnificent story of the resurrected Christ\u2019s visit to the Nephites, the Savior\u2019s Easter ministry. These Easter scriptures bear record of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nIn these chapters, Christ calls twelve disciples, teaches as He did in His Sermon on the Mount, announces that He has fulfilled the law of Moses, and prophesies about the latter-day gathering of Israel. He heals the sick and prays for the people in such a glorious way that \u201cno tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.\u201d\n\nThis Easter, our family is going to focus on the [[3 Nephi 11|first 17 verses of 3&nbsp;Nephi 11]], with which you are familiar. You recall the great multitude round about the temple in the land Bountiful who heard the voice of God the Father and saw Jesus Christ descending out of heaven to extend the most beautiful Easter invitation:\n\u201cArise and come forth unto me, \u2026 that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am \u2026 the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.\n\u201cAnd \u2026 the multitude went forth, \u2026 one by one \u2026 and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, \u2026 and did bear record, that it was he.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd \u2026 they did cry out with one accord, saying:\n\u201cHosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.\u201d\nImagine: the Nephites at the temple actually touched the hands of the risen Lord! We hope to make these chapters in 3&nbsp;Nephi as much a part of our Easter tradition as [[Luke 2|Luke 2]] is of our Christmas tradition. In reality, the Book of Mormon shares the greatest Easter story ever told. Let it not be the greatest Easter story never told.\nI invite you to look at the Book of Mormon in a new light and consider the profound witness it bears of the reality of the risen Christ as well as the richness and depth of the doctrine of Christ.\n\n\n\nThe Book of Mormon Testifies of Jesus Christ\n\nWe might ask, How can reading Book of Mormon scriptures at Easter bless our lives and those of our loved ones in a meaningful way? More than one might realize. Anytime we read and study from the Book of Mormon, we can expect remarkable outcomes.\nRecently, Lesa and I attended the viewing of a dear friend, a woman of faith whose life was cut short by illness. We gathered with her family and close friends, exchanging fond memories of this beautiful soul who had enriched our lives.\nWhile standing away some distance from the casket, conversing with others, I noticed two young Primary-age girls approach the casket and stretch up on their tiptoes\u2014eyes just reaching its edge\u2014to pay their final respects to their beloved aunt. With no one else nearby, Lesa slipped over and crouched down beside them to offer comfort and teaching. She asked how they were doing and if they knew where their aunt was now. They shared their sadness, but then these precious daughters of God, with confidence brimming in their eyes, said they knew their aunt was now happy and she could be with Jesus.\nAt this tender age, they found peace in the great plan of happiness and, in their own childlike way, testified of the profound reality and simple beauty of the Resurrection of the Savior. They knew this in their hearts because of thoughtful teachings of loving parents, family, and Primary leaders planting a seed of faith in Jesus Christ and eternal life. Wise beyond their years, these young girls understood truths that come to us through the Easter message and ministry of the resurrected Savior and the words of the prophets as told in the Book of Mormon.\nI have observed that when President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson gives a gift of the Book of Mormon to someone not of our faith, including world leaders, he often turns to 3&nbsp;Nephi and reads about the appearance of the resurrected Christ to the Nephites. In doing so, the *living* prophet is in essence bearing witness of the *living* Christ.\nWe cannot *stand* as witnesses of Jesus Christ until we can *bear* witness of Him. The Book of Mormon is another witness of Jesus Christ because throughout its sacred pages, one prophet after another testifies not only that Christ would come but that He *did* come.\n\n\n\nBecause of Him\n\n\u200bI am holding in my hand a copy of the first edition of the Book of Mormon. Doing so *always* moves me. For much of my adult life, I have been fascinated, enthralled, and riveted with what young Joseph Smith did to get this sacred book of scripture translated and published. The miracles that had to occur are staggering to contemplate.\n\u200bBut that is not why this book moves me. It is because this book, more than any other ever published on this earth, bears witness of the life, the ministry, the teachings, the Atonement, and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. My dear brothers and sisters, studying regularly from this book about Jesus Christ will change your life. It will open your eyes to new possibilities. It will increase your hope and fill you with charity. Most of all, it will build and strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ and bless you with a sure knowledge that He and our Father know you, love you, and want you to find your way back home, with a capital *H*.\nDear brothers and sisters, the time has come, foretold by prophets of old, \u201cwhen the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.\u201d We are seeing the fulfillment of this prophecy before our very eyes, through the witness of Jesus Christ found in the Book of Mormon.\n\nNo book does more to show that:\n\n\nBecause of Jesus Christ, everything changed.\n\n\nBecause of Him, everything is better.\n\n\nBecause of Him, life is manageable\u2014especially the painful moments.\n\n\nBecause of Him, everything is possible.\n\n\nHis visit as a resurrected Savior, introduced by God the Father, is a most glorious and triumphant Easter message. It will help our family members gain a personal testimony of Jesus Christ as our Savior and Redeemer, who broke the bands of death.\nI close with my testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon and of Jesus Christ as the Son of the living God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Nelson, as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2015the Lord\u2019s mouthpiece for this remarkable season of growth and revelation. Through him, we have received countless invitations and have been promised glorious blessings if we will center our lives on our Savior, Jesus Christ.\nIn 2011, while I was serving with my husband as mission leaders in beautiful Curitiba, Brazil, my phone rang during a meeting. Rushing to silence it, I noticed the call was from my father. I quickly left the meeting to answer: \u201cHi, Dad!\u201d\nUnexpectedly, his voice was filled with emotion: \u201cHi, Bonnie. I need to tell you something. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with ALS.\u201d\nMy mind swirled with confusion, \u201cWait! What is ALS?\u201d\nDad was already explaining, \u201cMy mind will stay alert while my body slowly shuts down.\u201d\nI felt my whole world shift as I began to wrestle with the implications of this grievous news. But on that unforgettable day, it was his last sentence that found a permanent place in my heart. My dear father said with urgency, \u201cBonnie, never give up an opportunity to testify of Christ.\u201d\nI have pondered and prayed over Dad\u2019s counsel. I have often asked myself if I fully know what it means to never give up an opportunity to testify of Jesus Christ.\nLike you, I have occasionally stood on the first Sunday of the month and borne a witness of Christ. Many times I have testified of gospel truths as part of a lesson. I have boldly taught truth and declared the divinity of Christ as a missionary.\nYet this plea felt more personal! It seemed as though he was saying, \u201cBonnie, don\u2019t let the world overtake you! Stay true to your covenants with the Savior. Seek to experience His blessings every day, and be able to testify through the Holy Ghost of His power and presence in your life!\u201d\nWe live in a fallen world, with distractions coaxing our eyes and hearts downward instead of heavenward. Much like the Nephites in [[3 Nephi 11|3&nbsp;Nephi 11]], *we need Jesus Christ*. Can you imagine yourself there, among people who had experienced so much chaos and destruction? What would it be like to hear the Lord\u2019s personal invitation:\n\u201cArise and come forth unto me, that ye may *thrust* your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may *know* that I am \u2026 the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.\n\u201cAnd \u2026 the multitude went forth \u2026 one by one \u2026 and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know \u2026 *and had witnessed for themselves*.\u201d\nThese Nephites eagerly went forward to thrust their hands into His side and feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet so they could witness for themselves that this was the Christ. Similarly, many faithful people we have studied in the New Testament this year had anxiously awaited Christ\u2019s coming. Then they stepped from their fields, workbenches, and dinner tables and followed Him, pressed upon Him, thronged Him, and sat with Him. Are we as anxious to witness for ourselves as the multitudes in the scriptures? Are the blessings we seek less needful than theirs?\nWhen Christ physically visited the Nephites at their temple, His invitation was not to stand at a distance and look upon Him, but to touch Him, to feel for themselves the reality of the Savior of humankind. How can we draw close enough to gain a personal witness of Jesus Christ? This may be part of what my father was trying to teach me. While we may not enjoy the same physical proximity as those who walked with Christ during His earthly ministry, through the Holy Ghost we can experience His power every day! As much as we need!\nThe young women around the world have taught me so much about seeking Christ and gaining a daily, personal witness of Him. Let me share the wisdom of two of them:\n**Livvy** has watched general conference her entire life. In fact, in her home they traditionally watch all five sessions as a family. In the past, conference for Livvy had meant doodling or drifting into the occasional unintended nap. But this past October general conference was different. It became personal.\nThis time, Livvy decided to be an active recipient. She silenced notifications on her phone and took notes of impressions from the Spirit. She was amazed as she felt specific things God wanted her to hear and do. This decision made a difference in her life almost immediately.\nJust days later her friends invited her to an inappropriate movie. She reflected, \u201cI felt the words and spirit of conference return into my heart, and I heard myself declining their invitation.\u201d She also had the courage to share her testimony of the Savior in her ward.\nAfter these events she stated, \u201cThe amazing thing is, when I heard myself testify that Jesus is the Christ, I felt the Holy Ghost confirm it again for me.\u201d\nLivvy did not skip like a stone over the surface of conference weekend; she dove in, mind and spirit, and found the Savior there.\nAnd then there is **Maddy**. When her family stopped attending church, Maddy was confused and not certain what to do. She realized something significant was missing. So at age 13, Maddy began attending church alone. Even though being alone was sometimes hard and uncomfortable, she knew she could find the Savior at church and she wanted to be where He was. She said, \u201cIn church my soul felt like it was at home.\u201d\nMaddy held onto the fact that her family had been sealed together for eternity. She started bringing her younger brothers with her to church and studying scriptures with them at home. Eventually her mom began joining them. Maddy told her mom of her desire to serve a mission and asked if her mom could be ready to attend the temple with her.\nToday Maddy is in the MTC. She is serving. She is witnessing of Christ. Her example helped lead *both* of her parents back to the temple and back to Christ.\nLike Livvy and Maddy, as we choose to seek Christ, the Spirit will witness of Him in many different situations. These witnesses of the Spirit occur as we fast, pray, wait, and continue forward. Our closeness to Christ grows through worshipping frequently in the temple, repenting daily, studying scriptures, attending church and seminary, pondering our patriarchal blessings, worthily receiving ordinances, and honoring sacred covenants. All of these invite the Spirit to enlighten our minds, and they bring added peace and protection. But do we honor them as sacred opportunities to testify of Christ?\nI have attended the temple many times, but when I *worship in the house of the Lord*, it changes me. Sometimes while fasting, I find myself simply going hungry, but other times, I *feast on the Spirit with purpose*. I sometimes have mumbled prayers that are repetitive and routine, but I have also come *eager to receive counsel from the Lord through prayer*.\nThere is power in making these holy habits less of a checklist and more of a witness. The process will be gradual but will grow with daily, active participation and purposeful experiences with Christ. As we consistently act on His teaching, we gain a testimony of Him; we build a relationship with Him and our Heavenly Father. We begin to become like Them.\nThe adversary creates so much noise that it can be difficult to hear the Lord\u2019s voice. Our world, our challenges, our circumstances will not get quieter, but we can and must hunger and thirst after the things of Christ to \u201chear Him\u201d with clarity. We want to create muscle memory of discipleship and testimony that will bring into focus our reliance on our Savior each day.\nMy father has been gone for over 11 years now, but his words are alive in me. \u201cBonnie, never give up an opportunity to testify of Christ.\u201d I invite you to join me in accepting his invitation. Look for Christ everywhere\u2015I promise He is there! True joy rests on our willingness to come closer to Christ and witness for ourselves.\nWe know that in the last days, \u201cevery knee shall bow, and every tongue confess\u201d that Jesus is the Christ. I pray this witness will become a normal and natural experience for us *now*\u2014that we will take every opportunity to joyfully testify: Jesus Christ lives!\nOh, how I love Him. How grateful we are for His infinite Atonement, which has \u201cmade eternal life a possibility and immortality a reality for [us] all.\u201d I testify of our Savior\u2019s goodness and great glory in His sacred name, even Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Elder George&nbsp;A. Smith, an Apostle, received counsel from the Prophet Joseph Smith at a time of great difficulty: \u201cHe told me I should never get discouraged, whatever difficulties might surround me. If I was sunk in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and all the Rocky Mountains piled on top of me, I ought not to be discouraged but hang on, exercise faith, and keep up good courage and I should come out on the top of the heap at last.\u201d\nHow could the Prophet Joseph say that\u2014to someone who was suffering? Because he knew it was true. He lived it. Joseph repeatedly experienced severe difficulties in his life. However, as he exercised faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement and just kept going, he overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles.\nToday I would like to renew Joseph\u2019s plea not to let discouragement overwhelm us when we face disappointment, painful experiences, our own inadequacies, or other challenges.\nWhen I say discouragement, I\u2019m not talking about the more debilitating challenges of clinical depression, anxiety disorders, or other illnesses that require special treatment. I\u2019m just talking about plain old discouragement that comes with the ups and downs of life.\nI am inspired by my heroes who just keep going\u2014with faith\u2014no matter what. In the Book of Mormon, we read of Zoram, the servant of Laban. When Nephi obtained the brass plates, Zoram was faced with the choice to follow Nephi and his brothers into the wilderness or possibly lose his life.\nWhat a choice! Zoram\u2019s first inclination was to run, but Nephi held him and made an oath that if he would go with them, he would be free and have a place with their family. Zoram took courage and went with them.\nZoram suffered many afflictions in his new life, yet he pressed forward with faith. We have no indication that Zoram clung to his past or harbored resentment toward God or others. He was a true friend to Nephi, a prophet, and he and his seed dwelt in freedom and prosperity in the promised land. What had been a huge obstacle in Zoram\u2019s path eventually led to rich blessings, due to his faithfulness and willingness to just keep going\u2014with faith.\nRecently I listened to a courageous sister share how she persevered through difficulties. She had some challenges, and one Sunday she was sitting in Relief Society, listening to a teacher who she thought lived a picture-perfect life\u2014totally different from her own. She was tired and discouraged. She felt like she didn\u2019t measure up\u2014or even belong\u2014so she got up and left, planning to never return to church again. Walking to her car, she felt a distinct impression: \u201cGo into the chapel and listen to the sacrament meeting speaker.\u201d She questioned the prompting but felt it again strongly, so she went into the meeting.\nThe message was exactly what she needed. She felt the Spirit. She knew the Lord wanted her to stay with Him, to be His disciple, and to attend church, so she did.\nDo you know what she was grateful for? That she didn\u2019t give up. She just kept going\u2014with faith in Jesus Christ, even when it stretched her, and she and her family are being abundantly blessed as she presses forward.\nThe God of heaven and earth will help us overcome discouragement and whatever obstacles we encounter if we look to Him, follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, and just keep going\u2014with faith.\nThankfully, when we are weak or incapable, the Lord can strengthen our faith. He can increase our capacity beyond our own. I have experienced that. More than 20 years ago, I was unexpectedly called as an Area Seventy, and I felt very inadequate. Following my training assignments, I was to preside at my first stake conference. The stake president and I meticulously planned every detail. Shortly before the conference, President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer, then\u2013Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, called to see if he could accompany me. I was surprised and, of course, agreed. I asked how he would like to proceed since he would preside. He suggested that we undo the plans and prepare to follow the Spirit. Thankfully, I still had 10 days to study, pray, and prepare.\nWith an open agenda, we were on the stand 20 minutes before the leadership meeting began. I leaned over to the stake president and whispered, \u201cThis is a wonderful stake.\u201d\nPresident Packer elbowed me gently and said, \u201cNo talking.\u201d\nI stopped talking, and his general conference talk \u201cReverence Invites Revelation\u201d came to mind. I observed that President Packer was writing down scripture references. The Spirit confirmed to me that he was receiving impressions for the meeting. My learning experience had just begun.\nPresident Packer spoke for the first 15 minutes and emphasized the importance of conducting all meetings as guided by the Holy Spirit. He then said, \u201cWe will now hear from Elder Cook.\u201d\nOn my way to the pulpit, I asked how long he would like me to take and if there was a topic he would like me to address. He said, \u201cTake 15 minutes and carry on as you feel inspired.\u201d I took about 14 minutes and shared everything I had on my mind.\nPresident Packer stood again and spoke for another 15 minutes. He shared this scripture:\n\u201cSpeak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be confounded before men;\n\u201cFor it shall be given you \u2026 in the very moment, what ye shall say.\u201d\nThen he said, \u201cWe will now hear from Elder Cook.\u201d\nI was shocked. I had never considered the possibility that I would be asked to speak twice in one meeting. I didn\u2019t have anything in mind to say. Praying fervently and relying on the Lord for help, somehow, I was blessed with a thought, a scripture, and I was able to speak for another 15 minutes. I sat down totally exhausted.\nPresident Packer spoke again for 15 minutes about following the Spirit and shared Paul\u2019s teachings that we should not speak \u201cwords which man\u2019s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.\u201d As you can imagine, I was overwhelmed when he was impressed to say for the third time, \u201cWe will now hear from Elder Cook.\u201d\nI was empty. I had nothing. I knew it was time to exercise more faith. Slowly, I made my way to the pulpit, pleading to God for help. As I stepped up to the microphone, the Lord miraculously blessed me to somehow give another 15-minute message.\nThe meeting finally ended, but I quickly realized that the adult session would start in one hour. Oh, no! Like Zoram, I sincerely wanted to run, but just as Nephi caught him, I knew President Packer would catch me. The adult meeting followed the very same pattern. I spoke three more times. The next day during the general session, I spoke once.\nAfter the conference, President Packer said with affection, \u201cLet\u2019s do it again sometime.\u201d I love President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer and appreciate all that I learned.\nDo you know what I am grateful for? That I didn\u2019t give up\u2014or resist. If I had given in to my desperate desire to escape from those meetings, I would have missed an opportunity to increase my faith and receive a rich outpouring of love and support from my Heavenly Father. I learned of His mercy, the miraculous enabling power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement, and the powerful influence of the Holy Ghost. In spite of my weakness, I learned that I can serve; I can contribute when the Lord is by my side if I just keep going\u2014with faith.\nRegardless of the size, scope, and seriousness of the challenges we face in life, we all have times when we feel like stopping, leaving, escaping, or possibly giving up. But exercising faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ, helps us overcome discouragement no matter what obstacles we encounter.\nJust as the Savior finished the work He was given to do, He has the power to help us finish the work we have been given. We can be blessed to move forward along the covenant path, no matter how rocky it becomes, and eventually receive eternal life.\nAs the Prophet Joseph Smith said, \u201cStand fast, ye Saints of God, hold on a little while longer, and the storm of life will be past, and you will be rewarded by that God whose servants you are.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

In spite of my weakness, I learned that I can serve; I can contribute when the Lord is by my side if I just keep going\u2014with faith."

        "full_markdown": "Dear brothers and sisters, friends, welcome to general conference!\nAfter general conference last October, Sister Gong and I walked through the Conference Center to say hello and to hear your gospel experiences.\nOur members from Mexico said, \u201cHoy es el tiempo de M\u00e9xico.\u201d\n\nWe learned Gilly and Mary are friends from England. When Mary joined the Church, she lost her place to live. Gilly generously invited Mary to come live with her. Full of faith, Gilly says, \u201cI\u2019ve never doubted the Lord is with me.\u201d At conference, Gilly also had a joyful reunion with the sister missionary who taught her 47 years ago.\n\nJeff and his wife, Melissa, were attending general conference for his first time. Jeff played professional baseball (he was a catcher) and is now a physician anesthesiologist. He told me, \u201cMuch to my surprise, I am moving toward baptism because it feels like the most authentic and honest way to live.\u201d\nEarlier, Melissa had apologized to Jeff\u2019s assigned ministering brother, \u201cJeff does not want \u2018white shirts\u2019 in our house.\u201d The ministering brother said, \u201cI\u2019ll find a way.\u201d Now he and Jeff are good friends. At Jeff\u2019s baptism, I met a congregation of Latter-day Saints whom Jeff, Melissa, and their daughter, Charlotte, love.\nAs followers of Jesus Christ, we seek to minister to others as He would because lives are waiting to change.\nWhen Peggy told me her husband, John, after 31 years of marriage, was going to be baptized, I asked what had changed.\nPeggy said, \u201cJohn and I were studying the New Testament Come, Follow Me, and John asked about Church doctrine.\u201d\nPeggy said, \u201cLet\u2019s invite the missionaries.\u201d\nJohn said, \u201cNo missionaries\u2014unless my friend can come.\u201d Over 10 years, John\u2019s ministering brother had become his trusted friend. (I thought, What if John\u2019s ministering brother had stopped coming after one, two, or nine years?)\nJohn listened. He read the Book of Mormon with real intent. When the missionaries invited John to be baptized, he said yes. Peggy said, \u201cI fell off my chair and started to cry.\u201d\nJohn said, \u201cI changed as I drew closer to the Lord.\u201d Later, John and Peggy were sealed in the holy temple. Last December, John passed away at age 92. Peggy says, \u201cJohn was always a good person, but he became different in a beautiful way after he was baptized.\u201d\n\nSister Gong and I met Meb and Jenny by video during the COVID pandemic. (We met many wonderful couples and individuals by video during COVID, each prayerfully introduced by their stake president.)\nMeb and Jenny humbly said concerns in their lives made them wonder if their temple marriage could be saved and, if so, how. They believed Jesus Christ\u2019s Atonement and their covenant commitments could help them.\nImagine my joy when Meb and Jenny received new temple recommends and returned together to the house of the Lord. Later Meb almost died. What a blessing Meb and Jenny have restored covenant relationships with the Lord and each other and feel the ministering love of many around them.\nEverywhere I go, I gratefully learn from those who minister and care as our Savior would.\n\nIn Peru, Sister Gong and I met Salvador and his siblings. Salvador and his siblings are orphans. It was Salvador\u2019s birthday. The Church leaders and members who faithfully minister to this family inspire me. \u201cPure religion and undefiled \u2026 is this, To visit the fatherless and widows,\u201d \u201csuccor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, \u2026 strengthen the feeble knees.\u201d\nIn Hong Kong, an elders quorum president modestly shares how their quorum consistently conducts 100-percent ministering interviews. \u201cWe prayerfully organize companionships so everyone can care for someone and be cared for,\u201d he says. \u201cWe regularly ask each companionship about those for whom they minister. We do not check boxes; we minister to the ministers who care for our people.\u201d\n\nIn Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, President Bokolo shares how he and his family joined the Church in France. One day, as he was reading his patriarchal blessing, the Spirit inspired Brother Bokolo to return with his family to the DR Congo. Brother Bokolo knew they would face many challenges if they returned. And their church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was not yet established in Kinshasa.\nYet, in faith, as have many others, the Bokolos followed the Lord\u2019s Spirit. In Kinshasa, they ministered to and blessed those around them, overcame challenges, received spiritual and temporal blessings. Today, they rejoice in having a house of the Lord in their country.\nA convert was ministered to by personal example. As a young man, he said he spent his days lounging at the beach. One day, he said, \u201cI saw an attractive girl in a modest swimsuit.\u201d Amazed, he went to ask why such an attractive girl would wear such a modest swimsuit. She was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and asked with a smile, \u201cWould you like to come to church Sunday?\u201d He said yes.\nYears ago, while we were on an assignment together, Elder L.&nbsp;Tom Perry shared how he and his companion regularly ministered to a sister who lived alone in a rough Boston neighborhood. When Elder Perry and his companion arrived, the sister cautiously directed, \u201cSlide your temple recommends under the door.\u201d Only after seeing the temple recommends would she unbolt multiple locks and open the door. Of course, I am not saying ministering companionships need temple recommends. But I love the thought that as those who honor covenants minister, homes unlock and hearts open.\nElder Perry also offered practical advice. He said, \u201cGive companionships a reasonable number of assignments, prayerfully chosen, clustered geographically where appropriate so travel time is used well.\u201d He would counsel, \u201cStart with those who most need visits. Build from those most likely to welcome and respond well to visits.\u201d He concluded, \u201cFaithful consistency brings miracles.\u201d\n\nHigher and holier ministering comes when we pray for \u201cthe pure love of Christ\u201d and follow the Spirit. It also comes as elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies, under the bishop\u2019s direction, oversee ministering efforts, including assigning ministering companionships. Please give our young men and young women needed opportunity to accompany and be mentored by experienced ministering brothers and sisters. And please let our young rising generation inspire ministering brother and sister companions.\nIn some places in the Church, we have a ministering gap. More say they are ministering than say they are being ministered to. We do not want checklist concern. But often we need more than a sincere hello in the hall or a casual \u201cCan I help you?\u201d in the parking lot. In many places, we can reach out, understand others where they are, and build relationships when we regularly visit members in their homes. Inspired invitations change lives. When invitations help us make and keep sacred covenants, we draw closer to the Lord and each other.\nIt is said that those who understand the true spirit of ministering do more than before, while those who do not understand do less. Let\u2019s do more, as our Savior would. As our hymn says, it is \u201ca blessing of duty and love.\u201d\nWard councils, elders quorums, and Relief Societies, please hearken to the Good Shepherd and help Him \u201cseek that which was lost, \u2026 bring again that which was driven away, \u2026 bind up that which was broken, \u2026 strengthen that which was sick.\u201d We may entertain \u201cangels unawares\u201d as we make room in His inn for all.\nInspired ministering blesses families and individuals; it also strengthens wards and branches. Think of your ward or branch as a spiritual ecosystem. In the spirit of the Book of Mormon allegory of the olive trees, the Lord of the vineyard and his servants bring forth precious fruit and strengthen each tree by binding together the strengths and weaknesses of all the trees. The Lord of the vineyard and his servants repeatedly ask, \u201cWhat more can I do?\u201d Together, they bless hearts and homes, wards and branches, through inspired, consistent ministering.\n\nMinistering\u2014shepherding\u2014makes our vineyard \u201cone body\u201d\u2014a sacred grove. Each tree in our grove is a living family tree. Roots and branches intertwine. Ministering blesses generations. When service is needed, wise bishops and elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies ask, \u201cWho are the ministering brothers and sisters?\u201d Ward councils and ministering interviews ask not only about challenges or problems but also look with eyes to see and rejoice in the Lord\u2019s many tender mercies in our lives as we minister as He would.\nOur Savior is our perfect example. Because He is good, He can go about doing good. He blesses the one and the 99. He is ministering personified. We become more like Jesus Christ when we do \u201cunto \u2026 the least of these\u201d as we would unto Him, when we love our neighbor as ourselves, when we \u201clove one another; as I have loved you,\u201d and when \u201cwhosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.\u201d\nJesus Christ ministers. Angels minister. Followers of Jesus Christ \u201cminister one to another,\u201d \u201crejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep,\u201d \u201cwatch over [and] \u2026 nourish [the people] with things pertaining to righteousness,\u201d \u201cremember \u2026 the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted,\u201d let His name be known through our ministry. As we minister as He would, we witness His miracles, His blessings. We obtain \u201ca more excellent ministry.\u201d\nWe may tire physically. But in His service we do \u201cnot weary in well-doing.\u201d We diligently do our best, do not run faster than we have strength, but trust, as the Apostle Paul teaches, that \u201cGod loveth a cheerful giver.\u201d For God who \u201cministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown.\u201d In other words, God enriches \u201cevery thing to all bountifulness.\u201d They \u201cwhich soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.\u201d\nWherever we are in this Easter season, let us reach out and care as our Savior would, especially to those whom we are privileged by love and assignment to minister. In so doing, may we draw closer to Jesus Christ and each other, becoming more like Him and the followers of Jesus Christ He would have us each be. In His sacred name, Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, our beloved prophet, has profoundly emphasized that our unique responsibility is to help gather scattered Israel and prepare the world for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The Father of our spirits desires His children to be *safely gathered home*.\nOur Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for safely gathering His children to our heavenly home is not based on worldly success, economic status, education, race, or gender. Father\u2019s plan is based on righteousness, keeping His commandments, and receiving sacred ordinances and honoring the covenants we make.\nThe divinely inspired doctrine that we are all brothers and sisters and \u201call are alike unto God\u201d underlies this great work of gathering. This doctrine accords with those who deeply desire for people of diverse economic and racial status to experience better lives. We applaud and join in such efforts. Moreover, we desire for all of God\u2019s children to come unto Him and receive the eternal blessings He offers through His gospel. In the Lord\u2019s preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, He declares, \u201cHearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.\u201d\nI love that the very first verse in the Doctrine and Covenants includes the people who are on \u201cthe islands of the sea.\u201d I have had three specific calls to serve and live on the islands of the sea. I first served as a young missionary to the British Isles, second as a new General Authority in the Philippine Islands, and then as Area President in the Pacific Islands, which includes many Polynesian islands.\nAll three of these areas have successfully gathered believers to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Missionaries first arrived in the British Isles in 1837. This was one year after Joseph Smith\u2019s dedication of the Kirtland Temple, where Moses committed \u201cthe keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.\u201d The early success in the British Isles is legendary. By 1851, over half the members of the Church were baptized converts living in the British Isles.\nIn 1961, Elder Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley visited and initiated full-time missionary efforts in the Philippine Islands. At that time there was only one Filipino Melchizedek Priesthood holder. Amazingly, there are over 850,000 members of the Church today in the Philippine Islands. I admire the Filipino people; they have a deep and abiding love for the Savior.\nPerhaps less well known is the ongoing missionary effort to the Polynesian Islands. It commenced in 1844 when Addison Pratt arrived in what is now French Polynesia. Many Polynesians already believed in eternal families and accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. Today almost 25 percent of Polynesians, in the Polynesian Islands, are members of the Church.\nI once listened to a 17-year-old girl on a distant Tahitian island who was a seventh-generation member. She paid tribute to her ancestors who had been converted in 1845 on Tubuai, two years before early Church members arrived in the Salt Lake Valley.\nOur doctrine is clear that there will be a time and a season for all people to receive and to respond to the gospel message. These examples are just a part of a much larger picture. President Nelson has continuously emphasized that the gathering of Israel is \u201c*the greatest* challenge, \u2026 cause, and \u2026 work on earth today.\u201d\nUntil the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ, including the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the revelation and priesthood keys given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, understanding of the gathering of Israel was fragmentary and limited.\nThe distinctive name \u201cIsrael\u201d was the title conferred upon Jacob. It came to represent the posterity of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob. The original promise and covenant to Father Abraham is set forth in [[Abraham 2|Abraham 2:9\u201310]], which reads in part:\n\u201cAnd I will make of thee a great nation,&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd I will bless [all nations] through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father.\u201d\nDuring the Council in Heaven in the premortal existence, the plan of salvation was discussed and *sustained*. It included certain laws and ordinances of the priesthood instituted before the foundation of the world and predicated upon the gathering. It also included the overriding principle of agency.\nAfter several centuries as a powerful people, including the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon, Israel was divided. The tribe of Judah and part of the tribe of Benjamin became the kingdom of Judah. The remainder, identified as the ten tribes, became the kingdom of Israel. After 200 years of separate existence, the first scattering of Israel occurred in 721&nbsp;BC when the ten tribes of Israel were carried away captive by the Assyrian king. They later went to the north countries.\nIn 600&nbsp;BC at the commencement of the Book of Mormon, Father Lehi led a colony of Israelites to the Americas. Lehi understood the scattering of Israel of which he was a part. He is quoted by Nephi as saying that the house of Israel \u201cshould be compared like unto an olive tree, whose branches should be broken off and should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.\u201d\nIn the so-called New World, the history of the Nephites and Lamanites as set forth in the Book of Mormon ends in approximately AD&nbsp;400. Descendants of Father Lehi are spread throughout the Americas.\nThis is clearly described by Mormon in [[3 Nephi 5|3&nbsp;Nephi 5:20]], which reads: \u201cI am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi. I have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem.\u201d\nClearly the high point in Israel\u2019s chronological history is the birth, message, ministry, and mission of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\nAfter the Savior\u2019s eternity-shaping death and Resurrection, a second well-known scattering of Judah occurred between AD 70 and AD 135 when, due to Roman oppression and persecution, the Jews dispersed throughout the then-known world.\nPresident Nelson has taught, \u201cThe Book of Mormon came forth as a sign that the Lord had commenced to gather [the] children of the covenant.\u201d Thus, the Book of Mormon, translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith through the gift and power of God, is directed to Lehi\u2019s descendants, scattered Israel, and Gentiles who are adopted into the tribes of Israel. The chapter heading to [[1 Nephi 22|1&nbsp;Nephi 22]] reads in part, \u201cIsrael will be scattered upon all the face of the earth\u2014The Gentiles will nurse and nourish Israel with the gospel in the last days.\u201d The [Book of Mormon title page](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng) reads that one of the book\u2019s purposes is for \u201cthe convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ.\u201d With the Restoration and Book of Mormon, the concept of gathering Israel has greatly expanded.\nThose who accept the gospel of Jesus Christ, regardless of lineage, become part of gathered Israel. With that gathering and the numerous temples built and announced, we are in a unique position to gather Israel on both sides of the veil as never before under the Father\u2019s plan.\nPresident Spencer&nbsp;W. Kimball, speaking of the literal gathering of Israel, stated: \u201cNow, the gathering of Israel consists of joining the true church and \u2026 coming to a knowledge of the true God. \u2026 Any person, therefore, who has accepted the restored gospel, and who now seeks to worship the Lord in his own tongue and with the Saints in the nations where he lives, has complied with the law of the gathering of Israel and is heir to all of the blessings promised the Saints in these last days.\u201d\n\u201cThe gathering of Israel now involves conversion.\u201d\nAs viewed through a clear lens, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have the great privilege of loving, sharing, inviting, and helping gather Israel to receive the fulness of the Lord\u2019s covenant blessings. This includes Africans and Europeans, South and North Americans, Asians, Australians, and those upon the isles of the sea. \u201cFor verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men.\u201d \u201cThis gathering shall continue until the righteous are assembled in the congregations of the Saints in the nations of the world.\u201d\nNo one has addressed the gathering more directly than President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson: \u201c*Anytime* you do *anything* that helps *anyone*\ufeff\u2014on either side of the veil\ufeff\u2014take a step toward making covenants with God and receiving their essential baptismal and temple ordinances, you are helping to gather Israel. It is as simple as that.\u201d\nWhere is the Church today? In the 62 years since I commenced serving a mission in 1960, the number of full-time missionaries serving under a call from the prophet has increased from 7,683 to 62,544. The number of missions has increased from 58 to 411. The number of members has increased from approximately 1,700,000 to approximately 17,000,000.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic temporarily impacted some of our opportunities to share the gospel. It also provided experience using new technology, which will greatly enhance the gathering. We are grateful that members and missionaries are now expanding efforts to gather scattered Israel. Growth continues everywhere, especially South America and Africa. We also appreciate that so many across the world have responded to President Nelson\u2019s powerful invitation for increased missionary service. Nevertheless, our commitment to love, share, and invite can be greatly expanded.\nAn essential part of this missionary effort is for individual members to become beacon-light examples wherever we live. We cannot be in camouflage. Our Christlike example of kindness, righteousness, happiness, and sincere love for all peoples can create not only a guiding beacon light for them but also an understanding that there is a safe harbor in the ordinances of salvation and exaltation of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.\nPlease understand that there are remarkable blessings in sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scriptures speak of joy and peace, forgiveness of sins, protection from temptations, and sustaining power from God. Looking beyond this mortal life, we will be prepared to share the gospel with those \u201cin darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.\u201d\nMy specific prayer today is for every child, young man, young woman, family, quorum, Relief Society, and class to review how we individually and collectively accept dramatic counsel to help gather Israel that has been issued by the Lord and our beloved prophet.\nWe respect agency. In this secular world, many will not respond and participate in the gathering of Israel. But many will, and the Lord expects those who have received His gospel to urgently strive to be a beacon-light example that will help others come to God. This allows our brothers and sisters across the earth to enjoy the supernal blessings and ordinances of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and be *safely gathered home.*\nI bear my sure and certain apostolic witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and our Father in Heaven\u2019s plan for us in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "When I was a young boy, I loved Saturday because everything I did on that day seemed like an adventure. But no matter what I did, it was always preceded by the most important thing of all\u2014watching cartoons on television. One such Saturday morning, as I was standing by the television and flipping through channels, I discovered that the cartoon I expected to find had been replaced by a broadcast of the general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While looking at the television and lamenting that there was no cartoon, I saw a white-haired man in a suit and tie sitting in a nice chair.\nThere was something different about him, so I asked my oldest brother, \u201cWho is that?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cThat\u2019s President David&nbsp;O. McKay; he\u2019s a prophet.\u201d\nI remember feeling something and somehow knowing that he was a prophet. Then, because I was a cartoon-crazed young boy, I changed the channel. But I\u2019ve never forgotten what I felt during that brief, unexpected revelatory moment. With a prophet, sometimes it only takes a moment to know.\nKnowing by revelation that there is a living prophet on the earth changes everything. It causes one to be uninterested in the debate about when is a prophet speaking as a prophet or whether one is ever justified in selective rejection of prophetic counsel. Such revealed knowledge invites one to trust the counsel of a living prophet, even if we do not fully understand it. After all, a perfect and loving Father in Heaven has chosen the pattern of revealing truth to His children through a prophet, someone who never sought such a sacred calling and who has no need of our help to be aware of his own imperfections. A prophet is someone God has personally prepared, called, corrected, inspired, rebuked, sanctified, and sustained. That is why we are never spiritually at risk in following prophetic counsel.\nWhether we like it or not, all of us were chosen in some fashion in the pre-earth life to be born in these latter days. There are two realities that are associated with the latter days. The first reality is that Christ\u2019s Church will be reestablished on the earth. The second reality is that things are going to get really challenging. The scriptures reveal that in the last days there will be \u201ca great hailstorm sent forth to destroy the crops of the earth,\u201d plagues, \u201cwars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, \u2026 and iniquity shall abound.\u201d\nWhen I was a child, those prophecies of the last days scared me and caused me to pray that the Second Coming would not come in my lifetime\u2014with some success I might add so far. But now I pray for the opposite, even though the prophesied challenges are assured, because when Christ returns to reign, all of His creations will \u201clie down safely.\u201d\nCurrent conditions in the world have caused some to panic. As God\u2019s covenant children, we do not need to chase after this or that to know how to navigate through these troubled times. We do not need to fear. The doctrine and principles that we must follow to survive spiritually and endure physically are found in the words of a living prophet. That is why President M.&nbsp;Russell Ballard declared that \u201cit is no small thing&nbsp;\u2026 to have a prophet of God in our midst.\u201d\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has testified that \u201cGod\u2019s long-established pattern of teaching His children through prophets assures us that He will bless each prophet and that He will bless those who heed prophetic counsel.\u201d So the key is to follow the living prophet. Brothers and sisters, unlike vintage comic books and classic cars, prophetic teachings do not become more valuable with age. That is why we should not seek to use the words of past prophets to dismiss the teachings of living prophets.\nI love the parables used by Jesus Christ to teach gospel principles. I would like to share a real-life parable of sorts with you this morning.\nOne day I walked into the cafeteria at Church headquarters to have some lunch. After getting a tray of food, I entered the dining area and noticed a table at which all three members of the First Presidency were seated, along with one empty chair. My insecurities caused me to make a quick detour away from that table, and then I heard the voice of our prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, saying, \u201cAllen, there\u2019s an empty chair right here. Come and sit down with us.\u201d And so I did.\nNear the end of the lunch, I was surprised to hear a loud crunching noise, and when I looked up, I saw that President Nelson had stood his plastic water bottle straight up and then flattened it and replaced the lid.\nPresident Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks then asked the question I wanted to ask, \u201cPresident Nelson, why did you flatten your plastic water bottle?\u201d\nHe replied, \u201cIt makes it easier for those who are handling recyclable materials because it doesn\u2019t take up as much space in the recycling container.\u201d\nWhile pondering that response, I heard the same crunching sound again. I looked to my right, and President Oaks had flattened his plastic water bottle just like President Nelson. I then heard some noise to my left, and President Henry&nbsp;B. Eyring was flattening his plastic water bottle, although he had adopted a different strategy by doing it while the bottle was horizontal, which took more effort than with the bottle straight up. Noticing this, President Nelson kindly showed him the bottle-straight-up technique to more easily flatten the bottle.\nAt that point, I leaned over to President Oaks and quietly asked, \u201cIs flattening your plastic water bottle a new recycling requirement of the cafeteria?\u201d\nPresident Oaks responded, with a smile on his face, \u201cWell, Allen, you need to follow the prophet.\u201d\nI\u2019m confident that President Nelson was not declaring some new recycling-based doctrine in the cafeteria that day. But we can learn from the prompt response of President Oaks and President Eyring to President Nelson\u2019s example and President Nelson\u2019s attentiveness to help teach those involved a better way.\nA number of years ago, Elder Neal&nbsp;A. Maxwell shared some observations and counsel that are prophetically on point with respect to our day:\n\u201cIn the months and years ahead, events are likely to require each member to decide whether or not he [or she] will follow the First Presidency. Members will find it more difficult to halt longer between two opinions.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026 Let us leave a record so that the choices are clear, letting others do as they will in the face of prophetic counsel. \u2026\n\u201cJesus said that when the fig trees put forth their leaves, \u2018summer is nigh.\u2019 \u2026 Thus warned that summer is upon us, let us not then complain of the heat!\u201d\n\nThe rising generation is growing up in a time when there are more fig leaves and there is more heat. That reality imposes a weightier responsibility on the already risen generation, particularly when it comes to following prophetic counsel. When parents ignore the counsel of the living prophet, they not only lose the promised blessings for themselves but even more tragically teach their children that what a prophet says is insignificant or that prophetic counsel can be picked through in a smorgasbord fashion without concern for the resulting spiritual malnutrition.\nElder Richard&nbsp;L. Evans once observed: \u201cSome parents mistakenly feel that they can relax a little as to conduct and conformity&nbsp;\u2026 that they can ease up a little on the fundamentals without affecting their family or their family\u2019s future. But if a parent goes a little off course, the children are likely to exceed the parent\u2019s example.\u201d\nAs a generation that has the sacred charge to prepare the rising generation for its prophesied role in the latter days, which role must be fulfilled in a time when the adversary\u2019s influence is at its peak, we cannot be a source of confusion about the importance of following prophetic counsel. It is that very counsel that will allow the rising generation to see \u201cthe enemy while he [is] yet afar off; and then [they can make] ready\u201d to withstand the enemy\u2019s attack. Our seemingly small deviations, quiet neglect, or whispered criticisms in response to prophetic counsel may result in our only walking dangerously near the edge of the covenant path; but when magnified by the adversary in the lives of the rising generation, such actions may influence them to leave that path altogether. Such a result is a generational price that is too high.\nSome of you may feel you have fallen short in your efforts to follow the counsel of President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson. If that is the case, then repent; begin again to follow the counsel of God\u2019s chosen prophet. Set aside the distraction of childish cartoons and trust the Lord\u2019s anointed. Rejoice because once again \u201cthere is a prophet in Israel.\u201d\nEven if you are unsure, I witness that we can withstand the heat of the latter days and even thrive in them. We are the Saints of the latter days, and these are great days. We were anxious to come to the earth at this time, having confidence that we would not be left to stumble when confronted by the adversary\u2019s increasingly darker and more confusing mists but rather to take counsel and direction from he who is authorized to say to us and the entire world, \u201cThus saith the Lord God.\u201d In the sacred name of the prophet whom God raised up, the Holy One of Israel, even Jesus Christ, amen.",

Such revealed knowledge invites one to trust the counsel of a living prophet, even if we do not fully understand it. After all, a perfect and loving Father in Heaven has chosen the pattern of revealing truth to His children through a prophet, someone who never sought such a sacred calling and who has no need of our help to be aware of his own imperfections. A prophet is someone God has personally prepared, called, corrected, inspired, rebuked, sanctified, and sustained. That is why we are never spiritually at risk in following prophetic counsel."

        "full_markdown": "My dear brothers and sisters, we have been blessed by the inspired teachings and the beautiful music that have touched us in this opening session of general conference. We thank you for your participation and for your faith.\nToday I will speak on what I have learned about the miracle of finding personal peace, whatever our circumstances. The Savior knows that all of Heavenly Father\u2019s children yearn for peace, and He said that He could give it to us. You remember the words of Jesus Christ recorded in the book of John: \u201cPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\u201d\nWhat He means by peace and how He can give it are revealed by the circumstances of those who heard Him speak those words. Listen to the account in John of the culmination of Christ\u2019s ministry. Fierce forces of evil were bearing down on Him and would soon come upon His disciples.\nHere are the Savior\u2019s words:\n\u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments.\n\u201cAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;\n\u201cEven the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.\n\u201cI will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\n\u201cYet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.\n\u201cAt that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.\n\u201cHe that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\n\u201cJudas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?\n\u201cJesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\n\u201cHe that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father\u2019s which sent me.\n\u201cThese things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.\n\u201cBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\n\u201cPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\u201d\nI have learned at least five truths from that teaching of the Savior.\nFirst, the gift of peace is given *after* we have the faith to keep His commandments. For those who are covenant members of the Lord\u2019s Church, obedience is what we have already promised to do.\nSecond, the Holy Ghost will come and abide with us. The Lord says that as we continue to be faithful, the Holy Ghost will dwell in us. That is the promise in the sacramental prayer that the Spirit will be our companion and that we will feel, in our hearts and minds, His comfort.\nThird, the Savior promises that as we keep our covenants, we can feel the love of the Father and the Son for each other and for us. We can feel Their closeness in our mortal lives, just as we will when we are blessed to be with Them forever.\nFourth, keeping the Lord\u2019s commandments requires more than obedience. We are to love God with all our heart, might, mind, and soul.\nThose who do not love Him do not keep His commandments. And so they will not have the gift of peace in this life and in the world to come.\nFifth, it is clear that the Lord loved us enough to pay the price of our sins so that we can\u2014through our faith in Him and our repentance, through the effects of His Atonement\u2014have the gift of the peace that \u201cpasseth all understanding,\u201d in this life and with Him eternally.\nSome of you, perhaps many, are not feeling the peace the Lord promised. You may have prayed for personal peace and spiritual comfort. Yet you may feel that the heavens are silent to your pleading for peace.\nThere is an enemy of your soul who does not want you and those you love to find peace. He cannot enjoy it. He works to prevent you from even wanting to find the peace the Savior and our Heavenly Father desire you to have.\nSatan\u2019s efforts to sow hatred and contention all around us seem to be increasing. We see evidence of it happening among nations and cities, in neighborhoods, in electronic media, and all across the world.\nYet there is reason for optimism: it is that the Light of Christ is placed in every newborn child. With that universal gift comes a sense of what is right, a desire to love and be loved. There is an inborn sense of justice and truth in every child of God as he or she comes into mortality.\nOur optimism for personal peace for those children lies in the people who care for them. If those who rear them and serve them have worked to receive the gift of peace from the Savior, they will, by personal example and effort, encourage the faith of the child to qualify for the supernal gift of peace.\nThat is what the scripture promises: \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\u201d It will require the one charged with the child\u2019s care and nurturing to be worthy of the gift of peace.\nSadly, we all have felt the pain when children raised by inspired parents\u2014sometimes one parent alone\u2014choose, after a lifetime of faith and peace, to take the path of sorrow.\nEven when that sadness occurs, my optimism rests in another gift from the Lord. It is this: that He raises up many peacemakers among His trusted disciples. They have felt the peace and the love of God. They have the Holy Ghost in their hearts, and the Lord can guide them to reach out to the wandering sheep.\nI have seen it over my lifetime and across the world. You have seen it as well. At times, when you are being led to the rescue, it may seem accidental.\nOnce, I simply asked someone I met on a trip, \u201cWould you tell me a little about your family?\u201d The conversation led me to ask to see a picture of her adult daughter, who she said was struggling. I was struck with the goodness in the face of that girl in the picture. I felt impressed to ask if I could have her email address. The daughter was at that moment lost and wondering if God had any message for her. He did. It was this: \u201cThe Lord loves you. He always has. The Lord wants you to come back. Your promised blessings are still in place.\u201d\nMembers across the Church have felt the Lord\u2019s gift of personal peace. He is encouraging everyone to help others have opportunities to come unto Him and qualify for that same peace themselves. They, in turn, will choose to seek inspiration to know how they can pass that gift along to others.\nThe rising generation will become the nurturers of the generation to follow. The multiplier effect will produce a miracle. It will spread and grow over time, and the Lord\u2019s kingdom on earth will be prepared and ready to greet Him with shouts of hosanna. There will be peace on earth.\nI bear my sure witness the Savior lives and that He leads this Church. I have felt His love in my life and His love and concern for all of Heavenly Father\u2019s children. The Savior\u2019s invitation to come to Him is an offer of peace.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson is the living prophet of God in all the earth. He has said, \u201cI give you my assurance that regardless of the world\u2019s condition and your personal circumstances, you can face the future with optimism and joy.\u201d\nI express my love to you. Your great faith and love are reaching people and allowing the Lord to change hearts and so gain a desire to offer others the gift of peace that passes all understanding.\nI pray that you may find peace, help many others to find it, and pass it along. There will be a wonderful thousand years of peace when the Lord comes again. I so testify in joy and in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Last November, I had the privilege of dedicating the Bel\u00e9m Brazil Temple. It was a joy to be with the consecrated members of the Church in northern Brazil. At that time, I learned that Bel\u00e9m is the gateway to the region that includes the most powerful river in the world, the Amazon River.\nDespite the river\u2019s strength, twice a year something seemingly unnatural happens. When the sun, moon, and earth are aligned just so, a powerful tidal wave flows up the river, against the natural flow of the water. Waves up to 6 meters high traveling as far as 50 kilometers upstream have been documented. This phenomenon, known generally as a tidal bore, is referred to locally as *pororoca*, or \u201cgreat roar,\u201d because of the loud noise it makes. We can correctly conclude that even the mighty Amazon must yield to heavenly powers.\nLike the Amazon, we have a natural flow to our lives; we tend to do what comes naturally. Like the Amazon, with heavenly help we can do seemingly unnatural things. After all, it is not natural for us to be humble, meek, or willing to submit our wills to God. Yet only by doing so can we be transformed, return to live in the presence of God, and achieve our eternal destiny.\nUnlike the Amazon, we can choose whether we yield to heavenly powers or \u201cgo with the flow.\u201d Going against the flow may be difficult. But when we yield \u201cto the enticings of the Holy Spirit\u201d and put off the selfish tendencies of the natural man or woman, we can receive the Savior\u2019s transforming power in our lives, the power to do difficult things.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught us how to do this. He promised, \u201cEach person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples\u2014and keeps them\u2014has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ \u2026 [to lift] us above the pull of this fallen world.\u201d In other words, we can access the power of God, but only when we connect with Him through sacred covenants.\nBefore the earth was created, God established covenants as the mechanism by which we, His children, could unite ourselves to Him. Based on eternal, unchanging law, He specified the nonnegotiable conditions whereby we are transformed, saved, and exalted. In this life, we make these covenants by participating in priesthood ordinances and promising to do what God asks us to do, and in return, God promises us certain blessings.\nA covenant is a pledge that we should prepare for, clearly understand, and absolutely honor. Making a covenant with God is different than casually making a promise. First, priesthood authority is required. Second, a feeble promise does not have the connecting strength to lift us above the pull of the natural flow. We make a covenant only when we intend to commit ourselves quite exceptionally to fulfilling it. We become covenant children of God and inheritors of His kingdom, especially when we identify ourselves completely with the covenant.\nThe term *covenant path* refers to a series of covenants whereby we come to Christ and connect to Him. Through this covenant bond, we have access to His eternal power. The path begins with faith in Jesus Christ and repentance, followed by baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost. Jesus Christ showed us how to enter the path when He was baptized. According to the New Testament Gospel accounts in Mark and Luke, Heavenly Father spoke directly to Jesus at His baptism, saying, \u201cThou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.\u201d When we embark on the covenant path through baptism, I can imagine Heavenly Father saying a similar thing to each of us: \u201cThou art my dear child in whom I delight. Keep going.\u201d\nAt baptism and when we partake of the sacrament, we witness that we are willing to take on ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. In this context, let us be mindful of the Old Testament commandment, \u201cThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\u201d To our modern ears, this sounds like a prohibition against irreverently using the Lord\u2019s name. The commandment includes that, but its injunction is even more profound. The Hebrew word translated as \u201ctake\u201d means to \u201clift up\u201d or \u201ccarry,\u201d as one would a banner that identifies oneself with an individual or group. The word translated as \u201cvain\u201d means \u201cempty\u201d or \u201cdeceptive.\u201d The commandment to not take the Lord\u2019s name in vain can thus mean, \u201cYou should not identify yourself as a disciple of Jesus Christ unless you intend to represent Him well.\u201d\nWe become His disciples and represent Him well when we intentionally and incrementally take on ourselves the name of Jesus Christ through covenants. Our covenants give us power to stay on the covenant path because our relationship with Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father is changed. We are connected to Them by a covenantal bond.\nThe covenant path leads to the ordinances of the temple, such as the temple endowment. The endowment is God\u2019s gift of sacred covenants that connect us more fully to Him. In the endowment, we covenant, first, to strive to keep the commandments of God; second, to repent with a broken heart and contrite spirit; third, to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. We do this by exercising faith in Him, making covenants with God as we receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation, keeping those covenants throughout our lives, and striving to live the two great commandments to love God and neighbor. We covenant, fourth, to keep the law of chastity and, fifth, to dedicate ourselves and everything the Lord blesses us with to build up His Church.\nBy making and keeping temple covenants, we learn more about the Lord\u2019s purposes and receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost. We receive direction for our lives. We mature in our discipleship so that we do not remain perpetual, unknowing children. Rather, we live with an eternal perspective and are more motivated to serve God and others. We receive increased capacity to fulfill our purposes in mortality. We are protected from evil, and we gain greater power to resist temptation and to repent when we stumble. When we falter, the memory of our covenants with God helps us return to the path. By connecting to God\u2019s power, we become our own *pororoca*, able to go against the flow of the world, throughout our lives and into the eternities. Ultimately, our destinies are changed because the covenant path leads to exaltation and eternal life.\n\nKeeping covenants made in baptismal fonts and in temples also provides us with strength to withstand mortality\u2019s trials and heartaches. The doctrine associated with these covenants eases our way and provides hope, comfort, and peace.\nMy grandparents Lena Sofia and Matts Leander Renlund received God\u2019s power through their baptismal covenant when they joined the Church in 1912 in Finland. They were happy to be part of the first branch of the Church in Finland.\nLeander died from tuberculosis five years later when Lena was pregnant with their tenth child. That child, my father, was born two months after Leander\u2019s death. Lena eventually buried not just her husband but also seven of her ten children. As an impoverished widow, she struggled. For 20 years she did not get a good night\u2019s rest. During the day, she scrambled to provide food for her family. At night, she took care of dying family members. It is hard to imagine how she coped.\nLena persevered because she knew that her deceased husband and children could be hers through the eternities. The doctrine of temple blessings, including that of eternal families, brought her peace because she trusted in the sealing power. While in mortality, she neither received her endowment nor was she sealed to Leander, but Leander remained a vital influence in her life and part of her great hope for the future.\nIn 1938, Lena submitted records so that temple ordinances could be performed for her deceased family members, some of the earliest submitted from Finland. After she died, temple ordinances were performed by others for her, Leander, and her deceased children. By proxy, she was endowed, Lena and Leander were sealed to each other, and their deceased children and my father were sealed to them. Like others, Lena \u201cdied in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, \u2026 [was] persuaded of them, and embraced them.\u201d\nLena lived as though she had already made these covenants in her life. She knew that her baptismal and sacramental covenants connected her to the Savior. She \u201clet the sweet longing for [the Redeemer\u2019s] holy place bring hope to [her] desolate heart.\u201d Lena considered it one of God\u2019s great mercies that she learned about eternal families before experiencing the tragedies in her life. Through covenant, she received the power of God to endure and rise above the depressive pull of her challenges and hardships.\nAs you walk the covenant path, from baptism to the temple and throughout life, I promise you power to go against the natural worldly flow\u2014power to learn, power to repent and be sanctified, and power to find hope, comfort, and even joy as you face life\u2019s challenges. I promise you and your family protection against the influence of the adversary, especially when you make the temple a major focus in your life.\nAs you come to Christ and are connected to Him and our Heavenly Father by covenant, something seemingly unnatural happens. You are transformed and become perfected in Jesus Christ. You become a covenant child of God and an inheritor in His kingdom. I can imagine Him saying to you, \u201cThou art my dear child in whom I delight. Welcome home.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Moroni promises that if we read the Book of Mormon and then ask God the Eternal Father with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ if it is true, God will manifest its truth by the power of the Holy Ghost. Millions of people have applied this promise and received an assuring witness of the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nMoroni exhorts us, as we read the Book of Mormon, to \u201cremember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until [this] time, \u2026 and [to] ponder it in [our] hearts.\u201d The stories and teachings in the Book of Mormon remind us and testify of the Savior\u2019s love, compassion, and mercy.\nMy father passed away in April 2013. As I prepared to speak at his funeral, I realized how blessed I was to know and love his favorite scriptures. He shared them in family gatherings, and he read them with me when I needed counsel, guidance, or strengthening of my faith. I heard him share them in talks and assignments. I not only knew them, but I can still remember the sound of his voice and the spiritual feelings I had as he shared them. Through sharing scriptures and feelings, my father helped me to establish a firm foundation of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\nMy father particularly loved the account of the Savior\u2019s visit to the people of Nephi. This sacred account is of the resurrected and exalted Lord Jesus Christ. He had drunk of the bitter cup and suffered all things so that we would not suffer if we would repent. He had visited the spirit world and organized the preaching of the gospel there. He had risen from the dead, and He had been with and received commandments from the Father to share scriptures with the Nephites that would bless future generations. He was exalted and had all of His eternal power and capacity. We can learn from every detail of His teachings.\nIn [[3 Nephi 11|3&nbsp;Nephi 11]], we read how the Savior descended out of heaven to teach the Nephites that He was Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified would come into the world. He declared that He was the Light of the World and that He glorified the Father in taking on the sins of the world. He invited the people to come forth to put their hands into His side and to feel the prints of the nails in His hands and in His feet. He wanted them to know that He was the God of Israel, who was slain for the sins of the world. The people joyfully responded, going forth one by one until they had all seen and felt that it was truly He of whom it was written by the prophets that should come.\nJesus taught the Nephites about the importance of repentance, about becoming as a little child, and about the need to be baptized by one having His authority. He then taught much of the doctrine that we are studying this year in the New Testament.\nIn [[3 Nephi 17|3&nbsp;Nephi 17]], we read that Jesus told the people it was time for Him to go unto the Father and also to show Himself unto the lost tribes of Israel. As He cast His eyes on the multitude, He noticed that they were in tears, looking steadfastly upon Him as if they would ask Him to tarry a little longer.\nThe Savior\u2019s response to the Nephites was both touching and instructive. He said, \u201cBehold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.\u201d\nI believe that His compassion was much more than a response to the people\u2019s tears. It seems that He could see them through the eyes of His atoning sacrifice. He saw their every pain, affliction, and temptation. He saw their sicknesses. He saw their infirmities, and He knew from His agonizing suffering in Gethsemane and on Golgotha how to succor them according to their infirmities.\nSimilarly, when our Savior, Jesus Christ, looks upon us, He sees and understands the pain and burden of our sins. He sees our addictions and challenges. He sees our struggles and afflictions of any kind\u2014and He is filled with compassion toward us.\nHis gracious invitation to the Nephites followed: \u201cHave ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.\u201d\nAnd the people came forth \u201cwith all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.\u201d\n\nIn 1990 we were living in the small town of Sale, in Victoria, Australia. We were happily busy with family, Church, and work commitments. On a beautiful summer Saturday just before Christmas, we decided to visit some parks and a favorite beach. After enjoying a wonderful day playing as a family, we packed everyone into the car and headed home. While driving, I momentarily fell asleep and caused a head-on car accident. After some moments of recovery, I looked around the vehicle. My wife, Maxine, had a badly broken leg and was struggling to breathe. She had a broken sternum. Our three daughters were in shock but thankfully appeared to be OK. I had some minor injuries. But our five-month-old son was unresponsive.\nAmid the stress and confusion of that accident scene, our eldest daughter, 11-year-old Kate, said with urgency, \u201cDad, you need to give Jarom a blessing.\u201d After some struggle, my daughters and I managed to get out of the car. Maxine couldn\u2019t be moved. Carefully I picked Jarom up; then, while lying on the ground on my back, I gently placed him on my chest and gave him a priesthood blessing. By the time the ambulance arrived about 40 minutes later, Jarom was conscious.\nThat night I left three family members in the hospital and took a hushed taxi ride home with two of my daughters. Through the long night, I pled with Heavenly Father that my family and those injured in the other vehicle would recover. Mercifully, my prayers and fervently offered prayers by many others were answered. All were healed over time, a great blessing and tender mercy.\nYet I continued to have deep feelings of guilt and remorse for causing such a terrible accident. I would wake during the night and relive the horrific events. I struggled for years to forgive myself and to find peace. Then, as a priesthood leader, while assisting others to repent and helping them to feel the compassion, mercy, and love of the Savior, I realized that He could heal me.\nThe Savior\u2019s healing and redeeming power applies to accidental mistakes, poor decisions, challenges, and trials of every kind\u2014as well as to our sins. As I turned to Him, my feelings of guilt and remorse were gradually replaced with peace and rest.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught: \u201cWhen the Savior atoned for all mankind, He opened a way that those who follow Him can have access to His healing, strengthening, and redeeming power. These spiritual privileges are available to all who seek to hear Him and follow Him.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, whether you are carrying the burden of unresolved sin, suffering because of an offense committed against you long ago, or struggling to forgive yourself for an accidental mistake, you have access to the healing and redeeming power of the Savior Jesus Christ.\nI testify that He lives. He is our Savior and Redeemer. He loves us. He has compassion for us, He is filled with mercy, and He can heal you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "I was raised by wonderful parents who loved and faithfully taught us, their children, the gospel. Sadly, my beloved parents struggled in their marriage for years. I was a Primary child when I was told that they would likely divorce someday and my siblings and I would need to choose which parent to live with. As a result, for years I experienced significant anxiety; however, a gift from my Heavenly Father ultimately helped change everything for me\u2014my patriarchal blessing.\nAt age&nbsp;11, increasingly worried about my parents\u2019 relationship, I deeply desired my patriarchal blessing. I knew that my Heavenly Father knew me perfectly and knew my specific circumstances. And I also knew I would receive direction from Him. Immediately after my 12th birthday, I received my patriarchal blessing. That was more than half a century ago, but I vividly remember the details of that sacred experience.\nGratefully, we have inspired direction about patriarchal blessings in the Church\u2019s General Handbook:\n\u201cEvery worthy, baptized member is entitled to receive a patriarchal blessing, which provides inspired direction from Heavenly Father.\u201d\nA member should be \u201cmature enough to understand the significance and sacred nature of the blessing\u201d and \u201cunderstand the basic doctrine of the gospel.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally the member should be young enough that many important decisions in life are still ahead. \u2026 Priesthood leaders should not establish a minimum age for a member to receive a patriarchal blessing.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cEach patriarchal blessing is sacred, confidential, and personal.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cA person who receives a patriarchal blessing should treasure its words, ponder them, and live to be worthy to receive the promised blessings in this life and in eternity.\u201d\nOur beloved President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has repeatedly taught about the importance of a patriarchal blessing, that it gives each recipient \u201ca declaration of lineage back to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\u201d and that each blessing \u201cis personal scripture to you.\u201d\nMy patriarchal blessing was critically important to me when I was young for numerous reasons. First, through the power of the Holy Ghost, my patriarchal blessing helped me understand my true eternal identity\u2014who I really was and who I could become. It helped me know, as President Nelson has taught, that I was \u201ca *son* of God,\u201d \u201ca *[child]* of the covenant,\u201d and \u201ca *disciple* of Jesus Christ.\u201d I knew that I was known and loved by my Heavenly Father and my Savior and that They were personally involved in my life. This helped me desire to draw closer to Them and increase my faith and trust in Them.\nA dear friend who joined the Church as a young adult shared: \u201cWhen the patriarch placed his hands on my head and spoke my name, everything changed, \u2026 not just then but for the rest of my life. I immediately sensed that\u2014through the power by which he spoke\u2014I was known intimately and deeply. The words he spoke penetrated my entire being. I knew that Heavenly Father knew me, inside and out.\u201d\nKnowing who I really was helped me understand and desire to do what God expected of me.\nThis led me to study the covenants I had made and the promised blessings in God\u2019s covenant with Abraham. It gave me an eternal perspective that inspired me to more fully keep my covenants.\nI studied my patriarchal blessing frequently and, as a youth, often daily, which helped me feel the comforting, guiding influence of the Holy Ghost, who helped reduce my anxiety as I followed His promptings. This increased my desire to actively invite light, truth, and the Holy Ghost by studying my scriptures and praying daily and trying to more diligently study and follow the teachings of God\u2019s prophet and apostles. My patriarchal blessing also helped me desire to be more submissive to the will of my Heavenly Father, and that focus helped me experience great joy, despite my personal circumstances.\nI received spiritual strength each time I studied my patriarchal blessing. When my parents finally did divorce, my patriarchal blessing, as President Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson taught, had for me become \u201ca precious and priceless personal treasure,\u201d even \u201ca personal Liahona.\u201d\nNow, please don\u2019t misunderstand. I wasn\u2019t perfect. I made all sorts of mistakes. My eternal companion would confirm that I still do. But my patriarchal blessing helped me and continues to help me desire to do better and be better. Frequently studying my patriarchal blessing increased my desire to withstand temptation. It helped me have the desire and courage to repent, and repentance increasingly became a joyful process.\nIt was vital for me to receive my patriarchal blessing while I was young and while my testimony was still growing. And I am forever grateful that my parents and bishop understood that my desire indicated I was ready.\nWhen I was 12, the world was far less confusing and distracting than the world today. President Nelson has described today as \u201ca most complicated time in the history of the world,\u201d a world that is \u201csin-saturated\u201d and \u201cself-centered.\u201d Fortunately our youth today are much more mature than I was at 12, and they too have critically important decisions to make while they are young! They also need to know who they really are and that God loves them and is perfectly aware of them!\nNot everyone will desire their patriarchal blessing when I did. But I pray that members who have not yet received their patriarchal blessing will prayerfully seek to know when they are ready. I promise that if you prepare spiritually, your experience, like mine, will be sacred to you. I also pray that those who have already received their patriarchal blessing will study it and treasure it. Cherishing my patriarchal blessing while I was young blessed me with courage when I was discouraged, comfort when I was fearful, peace when I felt anxious, hope when I felt hopeless, and joy when I needed it most. My patriarchal blessing helped increase my faith and trust in my Heavenly Father and my Savior. It also increased my love for Them\u2014and it still does.\nI testify that patriarchal blessings do provide inspired direction from Heavenly Father. I bear my witness of the living reality of our Father in Heaven and His Son\u2014our Savior, Jesus Christ\u2014who know us, love us, and desire to bless us. I also know with certainty that President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson is God\u2019s prophet on the earth today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Throughout His mortal ministry, the Savior showed great compassion for all of God\u2019s children\u2014especially for those who were suffering or had fallen away. When criticized by the Pharisees for associating with and eating among sinners, Jesus responded by teaching three familiar parables. In each of these parables, He emphasized the importance of seeking out those who had strayed and the joy that is felt when they return. For example, in the parable of the lost sheep, He said, \u201c[Great] joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.\u201d\nMy desire today is to strengthen the connection between joy and repentance\u2014more specifically, the joy that comes when we repent and the feelings of joy we experience as we invite others to come unto Christ and receive His atoning sacrifice in their lives.\n\n\nWe Are That We Might Have Joy\n\nIn the scriptures, the word *joy* typically means much more than passing moments of contentment or even feelings of happiness. Joy in this context is a godly attribute, found in its fulness when we return to dwell in the presence of God. It is more profound, elevating, enduring, and life-changing than any pleasure or comfort this world can offer.\nWe were created to have joy. It is our intended destiny as children of a loving Heavenly Father. He wants to share His joy with us. The prophet Lehi taught that God\u2019s plan for each of us is that we \u201cmight have joy.\u201d Because we live in a fallen world, enduring joy or everlasting joy often seems beyond our reach. Yet in the very next verse, Lehi continues by explaining that \u201cthe Messiah [came to] \u2026 redeem [us] from the fall.\u201d Redemption, by and through the Savior Jesus Christ, makes joy possible.\nThe gospel message is a message of hope, of \u201cgood tidings of great joy,\u201d and the means whereby all can experience peace and occasions of joy in this life and receive a fulness of joy in the life to come.\nThe joy we speak of is a gift for the faithful, yet it comes with a price. Joy is not cheap or casually given. Rather, it is bought \u201cwith the precious blood of [Jesus] Christ.\u201d If we really understood the value of true, godly joy, we would not hesitate to sacrifice any worldly possession or make any necessary life changes to receive it.\nA powerful but humble king in the Book of Mormon understood this. \u201cWhat shall I do,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.\u201d\nIn response to the king\u2019s question, the missionary Aaron said, \u201cIf thou desirest this thing, \u2026 bow down before God \u2026 [and] repent of all thy sins.\u201d Repentance is the pathway to joy because it is the pathway that leads to the Savior Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nJoy Comes through Sincere Repentance\n\nFor some, to think of repentance as the pathway to joy might seem contradictory. Repentance, at times, can be painful and difficult. It requires admitting that some of our thoughts and actions\u2014even some of our beliefs\u2014have been wrong. Repentance also requires change, which, at times, can be uncomfortable. But joy and comfort are not the same thing. Sin\u2014including the sin of complacency\u2014limits our joy.\nAs stated by the psalmist, \u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\u201d As we repent of our sins, we must focus on the great joy that follows. The nights may seem long, but the morning does come, and oh, how exquisite is the peace and resplendent joy we feel as the Savior\u2019s Atonement frees us from sin and suffering.\n\n\n\nThere Can Be Nothing So Exquisite and Sweet\n\nConsider the experience of Alma in the Book of Mormon. He was \u201cracked with eternal torment,\u201d and his soul was \u201charrowed up\u201d because of his sins. But once he turned to the Savior for mercy, he \u201ccould remember [his] pains no more.\u201d\n\u201cAnd oh, what joy,\u201d he declared, \u201cand what marvelous light I did behold; yea, \u2026 there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.\u201d\nThis is the kind of joy available to those who come unto Jesus Christ through repentance. As President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught:\n\u201cRepentance opens our access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cWhen we choose to repent, we choose to change! We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves. We choose to grow spiritually and receive joy\u2014the joy of redemption in Him. When we choose to repent, we choose to become more like Jesus Christ!\u201d\nRepentance brings joy because it prepares our hearts to receive the influence of the Holy Ghost. To be filled with the Holy Ghost means to be filled with joy. And to be filled with joy means to be filled with the Holy Ghost. Our joy increases as we work daily to bring the Spirit into our lives. As taught by the prophet Mormon, \u201cNevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in [their] faith [in] Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation.\u201d The Lord promises all who work to follow Him, \u201cI will impart unto you \u2026 my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe Joy of Helping Others Repent\n\nAfter we have felt the joy that comes from sincere repentance, we quite naturally want to share that joy with others. As we do, our joy multiplies. That\u2019s exactly what happened to Alma.\n\u201cThis is my glory,\u201d he said, \u201cthat perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.\n\u201cAnd behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, \u2026 yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended [to] me.\u201d\nHelping others repent is a natural expression of our gratitude toward the Savior, and it is a source of great joy. The Lord has promised:\n\u201cIf it so be that you should \u2026 bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\n\u201cAnd now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me \u2026&nbsp;, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow Great Is His Joy in the Soul That Repenteth\n\nI find it helpful to try to imagine the joy the Savior must feel each time we receive the blessings of His atoning sacrifice in our lives. As cited by President Nelson, the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews shared this tender insight: \u201cLay aside every \u2026 sin which doth so easily beset us, \u2026 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; *who for the joy that was set before him* endured the cross \u2026 and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\u201d We speak often of the pain and suffering of Gethsemane and Calvary, but seldom do we speak of the great joy the Savior must have anticipated as He offered His life for us. Clearly, His pain and His suffering were for us, that we might experience the joy of returning with Him to the presence of God.\nAfter teaching the people in ancient America, the Savior expressed His great love for them by saying:\n\u201cNow, behold, my joy is great, even unto fulness, because of you \u2026&nbsp;; yea, and even the Father rejoiceth, and also all the holy angels.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;In [you] I have [a] fulness of joy.\u201d\n\n\n\nCome unto Christ and Receive His Joy\n\nBrothers and sisters, I conclude by sharing my personal witness, which I consider a sacred gift. I testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the world. I know that He loves each of us. His singular focus, His \u201cwork and [His] glory,\u201d is to help us receive a fulness of joy in Him. I am a personal witness that repenting daily and coming unto Jesus Christ is the way to experience joy\u2014joy beyond our imagination. That is why we are here on earth. That is why God prepared His great plan of happiness for us. Jesus Christ truly is \u201cthe way, the truth, and the life\u201d and the only \u201cname given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.\u201d I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "In my mind\u2019s eye, I see the aging prophet Nephi at his desk, the plates of gold spread before him, his stylus in hand.\nNephi was in the process of finishing his last engraving on the record. He wrote, \u201cAnd now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.\u201d But soon after, the Spirit urged Nephi to return to his record and write a concluding message. Under the powerful influence of the Holy Ghost, that great prophet took his stylus again in hand and wrote, \u201cWherefore, the things \u2026 I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words \u2026 I *must* speak concerning the doctrine of Christ.\u201d\nHow eternally grateful we are for those \u201cfew words\u201d and for the Spirit compelling Nephi to write them. Nephi\u2019s treatise on the doctrine of Christ is a treasure to those who feast upon it. It contains a vision of the Savior\u2019s baptism and the voice of the Son inviting all to follow Him and \u201cdo the things which [we] have seen [Him] do.\u201d It contains Nephi\u2019s witness that those who, with faith in Christ, sincerely repent of their sins and follow the Savior into the waters of baptism will \u201creceive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d We also hear the voice of the Father bearing record: \u201cYea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.\u201d\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson emphasized the singular importance of the doctrine of Christ during remarks to newly called mission leaders: \u201cMore than anything else, we want our missionaries \u2026 to have the doctrine of Christ engraved in their hearts\u2014rooted \u2026 in the marrow of their bones.\u201d\nPreach My Gospel summarizes five important elements of the doctrine of Christ. It says, \u201c[We] invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.\u201d\nBut the importance of the doctrine of Christ is not just for missionaries! And it is much more profound than a mere summary repetition of its five key elements. It encompasses the law of the gospel. It is the great plan for eternal life.\nBrothers and sisters, if we are to accept President Nelson\u2019s invitation to have the doctrine of Christ rooted in the marrow of *our* bones, we must deepen our conversion to the Lord by study, prayer, faithful living, and continual repentance. We must invite the Holy Ghost to engrave the doctrine of Christ in the \u201cfleshy tables of [our] heart[s]\u201d as deeply and as permanently as it was engraved by Nephi upon the plates of gold.\nLast October, President Nelson asked, \u201cWhat does it mean to overcome the world?\u201d Among other things, he said, \u201cIt means *trusting* the doctrine of Christ more than the philosophies of men.\u201d\nThe word *trust* is defined as an \u201cassured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something.\u201d That someone is Jesus Christ, and that something is His doctrine.\nSo how would intentionally *trusting* the doctrine of Christ change the way we live our lives?\nIf we *trust* the doctrine of Christ, we will trust Christ enough to live by His every word. We will make a lifelong study of Jesus Christ, His ministry, His teachings, and His infinite Atonement, including His glorious Resurrection. We will study His promises and the conditions upon which those promises are given. As we study, we will be filled with greater love for the Lord.\nIf we *trust* the doctrine of Christ, we will approach our Heavenly Father every day in humble, secret prayer, where we can express gratitude for the gift of His Son and for all of our blessings. We can pray for the revelatory companionship of the Holy Ghost, pray to align our will with His, pray to reflect upon our covenants and renew our commitment to keep them. We can pray to sustain and express love for our prophets, seers, and revelators; pray for the cleansing power of forgiveness; and pray for the strength to resist temptation. I invite you to make prayer a priority in your life, seeking each day to improve your communication with God.\nIf we *trust* the doctrine of Christ, we will set aside the shiny things of the world so that we can focus on the Redeemer of the world. We will limit or eliminate time spent on social media; digital games; wasteful, excessive, or inappropriate entertainment; the allure of this world\u2019s treasures and vanities; and any other activities that give place to the false traditions and misguided philosophies of men. It is only in Christ we find truth and lasting fulfillment.\nSincere repentance will become a joyful part of our lives\u2014both to be forgiven for sin and to be changed in the image of Christ. Repentance with faith in Christ gives us access to the Atonement of Christ. President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks has taught that when the Savior forgives, He \u201cdoes more than cleanse [us] from sin. He also gives [us] new strength.\u201d Each one of us needs this strength to keep the commandments of God and to fulfill the eternal purpose of our lives.\n\nIn Jesus and in His doctrine, we find strength. He said, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, that *this is my doctrine*, and whoso buildeth upon *this* buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.\u201d\nWe see this promise fulfilled in the lives of faithful people. It was a little over a year ago that I was privileged to meet Travis and Kacie. They were married civilly in 2007. At the time, Travis was not a member of the Church. Kacie, though raised in an active Latter-day Saint home, had drifted from her faith in her teens and had strayed from her foundation.\nIn 2018, Travis met the missionaries, and he was baptized in 2019. Travis became a missionary to Kacie, who also experienced a life-changing conversion. They were sealed in the temple in September 2020. About two years after his baptism, Travis was called to serve in the bishopric.\nTravis has a rare disease that continuously forms clusters of tumors in his internal organs. He has undergone many surgeries to remove the recurring tumors, but the disease is incurable. Several years ago, Travis was given fewer than 10&nbsp;years to live.\nKacie has *retinitis pigmentosa*, a rare genetic disease that causes irreversible narrowing of the field of vision until complete blindness sets in.\nKacie spoke to me of her future. She anticipated the time, not far distant, when she would be widowed, blind, without financial support, and left alone to raise four growing children. I asked Kacie how she could handle such a bleak future. She smiled peacefully and said, \u201cI have never been happier or more hopeful in my life. We hold to the promises we received in the temple.\u201d\nTravis is now the bishop. Two months ago he had another major surgery. But he is optimistic and peaceful. Kacie\u2019s vision has worsened. She now has a guide dog and is unable to drive. But she is content, raising her children and serving as a counselor in the Young Women presidency.\nTravis and Kacie are building their house on the rock. Travis and Kacie trust the doctrine of Christ and the promise that God \u201cshall consecrate [their] afflictions for [their] gain.\u201d In God\u2019s perfect plan, suffering with faith in Christ is linked to our becoming perfected in Christ. Like the wise man in the parable who built his house upon a rock, when the rain descends and the floods come and the winds blow and beat upon the house Travis and Kacie are building, it will fall not, for it will be founded upon a rock.\nJesus did not speak of the *possibility* of rain and flood and wind in our lives; He spoke of the *certainty* that storms will arise. The variable in this parable is not whether storms will come but how we have responded to His loving invitation to both hear and do what He has taught. There is no other way to survive.\nWhen we have built our houses on the foundation of a covenantal relationship with Christ, we are *trusting* the doctrine of Christ, and as we come unto Him, we have His promise of eternal life. People who trust the doctrine of Christ press forward with steadfastness in Christ and endure to the end. There is no other way to be saved in the kingdom of heaven.\nI bear my personal witness of the living, resurrected reality of Jesus Christ. I testify that God our Father so loved the world He sent His Son to redeem us from sin and heal us from sorrow. I testify that He has called a prophet of God in our time, even President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, through whom He speaks and guides us.\nWith all my heart, I invite you to trust the doctrine of Christ and build your lives upon the rock of the Redeemer. He will never fail you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Once upon a time, a father was about to leave for an evening bishopric meeting. His four-year-old daughter stepped in front of him, wearing pajamas and holding a copy of Book of Mormon Stories.\n\u201cWhy do you have to go to a meeting?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cBecause I am a counselor in the bishopric,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cBut you are my dad!\u201d his daughter protested.\nHe knelt in front of her. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cI know you want me to read to you and help you go to sleep, but tonight I need to help the bishop.\u201d\nHis daughter replied, \u201cDoesn\u2019t the bishop have a dad to help him go to sleep?\u201d\nWe are eternally grateful for the countless members who serve diligently in the Church of Jesus Christ every day. Your sacrifice is truly sacred.\nBut as this girl seemed to understand, there\u2019s something equally sacred\u2014something irreplaceable\u2014about a parent nurturing a child. It reflects the pattern of heaven. Our Father in Heaven, our Divine Parent, surely rejoices when His children are taught and nurtured by their parents on earth.\nParents, thank you for everything you\u2019re doing to raise your children. And children, thank you for everything you\u2019re doing to raise your parents, because as every parent knows, we often learn as much from our children about faith, hope, and charity as they learn from us!\n\n\nParents Have a Sacred Duty\n\nHave you ever thought about the tremendous risk our Father in Heaven takes each time He sends a child to earth? These are His spirit sons and daughters. They have limitless potential. They are destined to become glorious beings of goodness, grace, and truth. And yet they come to earth completely helpless, barely able to do anything besides cry for help. The memory of their time in God\u2019s presence is veiled over, along with the knowledge of who they really are and who they can become. They form their understanding of life, love, God, and His plan based on what they observe from the people around them\u2014especially their parents, who, honestly, are still trying to figure things out for themselves.\n\nGod has given parents the \u201csacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to \u2026 observe the commandments of God.\u201d\nThat\u2019s enough to keep even the best parents awake at night.\nMy message to all parents is this:\nThe Lord loves you.\nHe is with you.\nHe stands beside you.\nHe is your strength in guiding your children to make righteous choices.\nAccept this privilege and responsibility courageously and joyfully. Don\u2019t delegate this source of heavenly blessings to anyone else. Within the framework of gospel values and principles, you are the ones to guide your child in the details of daily decisions. Help your children build faith in Jesus Christ, love His gospel and His Church, and prepare for a lifetime of righteous choices. In fact, that is God\u2019s plan for parents.\nSatan will oppose you, distract you, try to discourage you.\nBut every child has received the Light of Christ as a direct line to heaven. And the Savior will help you, guide you, and encourage you. Seek His help. Inquire of the Lord!\n\nJust as Jesus Christ is the strength of youth, Jesus Christ is also the strength of parents.\n\n\n\nHe Magnifies Love\n\nSometimes we might wonder if someone else might be better qualified to guide and teach our children. But no matter how inadequate you may feel, you have something that uniquely qualifies you: your love for your child.\nA parent\u2019s love for a child is one of the strongest forces in the universe. It\u2019s one of the few things on this earth that can truly be eternal.\nNow, perhaps you feel that your relationship with your child is less than ideal. That\u2019s where the Savior\u2019s power comes in. He heals the sick, and He can heal relationships. He multiplies bread and fish, and He can multiply the love and the joy in your home.\nYour love for your children creates a rich environment for teaching truth and building faith. Make your home a house of prayer, learning, and faith; a house of joyful experiences; a place of belonging; a house of God. And \u201cpray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that [you] may be filled with [His] love, which he [bestows] upon \u2026 followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe Magnifies Small and Simple Efforts\n\nAnother strength you have, as a parent, is the opportunity for daily, ongoing influence. Peers, teachers, and media influencers come and go. But you can be the most constant, steady influence in your child\u2019s life.\nYour efforts may seem small compared to the loud voices your children hear in the world. At times it may feel that you\u2019re not accomplishing much. But remember that \u201cby small means the Lord can bring about great things.\u201d One home evening, one gospel conversation, or one good example may not change your child\u2019s life in a moment, any more than one drop of rain causes a plant immediately to grow. But the consistency of small and simple things, day after day, nourishes your children much better than an occasional flood.\nThat is the Lord\u2019s way. He speaks to you and your child with a still, small voice, not a voice of thunder. He healed Naaman not through \u201csome great thing\u201d but through the simple, repeated act of washing. The children of Israel enjoyed the feast of quail in the wilderness, but what kept them alive was the small and simple miracle of manna\u2014their daily bread.\nBrothers and sisters, daily bread is best prepared and served at home. Faith and testimony are best fostered in normal and natural ways, one bite at a time, in small and simple moments, in the constant flow of daily living.\nEvery moment is a teaching moment. Every word and action can be a guide for making choices.\nYou may not see the immediate effects of your efforts. But don\u2019t give up. \u201cAll things must come to pass in their time,\u201d the Lord said. \u201cWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for [you] are laying the foundation of a great work.\u201d What work could be greater than helping God\u2019s precious children learn who they really are and build their faith in Jesus Christ, His gospel, and His Church? Jesus Christ will bless and magnify your consistent efforts.\n\n\n\nHe Gives Revelation\n\nAnother powerful way the Lord supports parents is through the gift of personal revelation. God is eager to pour out His Spirit to guide parents.\nAs you are prayerful and sensitive to the Spirit, He will warn you of hidden dangers. He will reveal your children\u2019s gifts, their strengths, and their unspoken concerns. God will help you see your children as He sees them\u2014beyond their outward appearance and into their hearts.\nWith God\u2019s help, you can learn to know your children in a pure and heavenly way. I invite you to accept God\u2019s offer to guide your family by personal revelation. Seek His guidance in your prayers.\n\n\n\nA Mighty Change\n\nPerhaps the most important help Jesus Christ offers to parents is the \u201cmighty change\u201d of heart. It\u2019s a miracle every one of us needs.\n\nFor a moment, imagine this situation: You\u2019re at church, listening to a talk about families. The speaker describes a perfect home and an even more perfect family. Husband and wife never quarrel. Children stop reading their scriptures only when it\u2019s time to do homework. And the music of \u201cLove One Another\u201d is playing in the background. Before the speaker gets to the part about everyone cheerfully joining to clean the bathroom, you\u2019re already thinking, \u201cMy family is hopeless.\u201d\nDear brothers and sisters, relax! Everyone in the congregation is thinking the same thing! The fact is, all parents worry about not being good enough.\nFortunately, there is a divine source of help for parents: It is Jesus Christ. He is the source of our mighty change of heart.\nAs you open your heart to the Savior and His teachings, He will show you your weakness. If you trust Jesus Christ with a humble heart, He will make weak things become strong. He is the God of miracles.\nDoes that mean you and your family will be picture-perfect? No. But you will get better. Through the Savior\u2019s grace, little by little, you\u2019ll develop more of the attributes parents need: *love for God and His children, patience, selflessness, faith in Christ, and courage to make righteous choices*.\n\n\n\nJesus Christ Offers Support through His Church\n\nOur effort to build faith in Jesus Christ is home centered, focused on the individual. And it is Church supported. Besides providing the sacred scriptures and the words of prophets, the Savior\u2019s Church offers many resources to help parents and children make righteous choices:\n\n\n\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices does not give you a list of dos or don\u2019ts. It teaches eternal truths to help make choices centered on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Read it with your children. Let them talk about it. Help them to have these eternal and divine truths guide their choices.\n\n\nFSY conferences are another wonderful resource. I hope every youth will attend. I invite young single adults to join these conferences as mentors and counselors. I invite parents to build on the spiritual momentum their youth bring home from FSY conferences.\n\n\nChildren and youth in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have teachers, advisers, and mentors. Often you enter a young person\u2019s life at a crucial moment to build and support faith and testimony. Some of you are single adults. Some never had children of your own. Your joyful service to God\u2019s children is sacred in God\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nNever Give Up on the Miracle\n\nMy dear friends, my dear brothers and sisters, building faith in a child is somewhat like helping a flower grow. You cannot tug on the stem to make it taller. You cannot pry open the bud to get it to blossom sooner. And you cannot *neglect* the flower and expect it to grow or flourish spontaneously.\nWhat you can and must do for the rising generation is provide rich, nourishing soil with access to flowing heavenly water. Remove weeds and anything that would block heavenly sunlight. Create the best possible conditions for growth. Patiently allow the rising generation to make inspired choices, and let God work His miracle. The result will be more beautiful and more stunning and more joyful than anything you could accomplish just by yourself.\n\nIn Heavenly Father\u2019s plan, families\u2019 relationships are meant to be eternal. This is why, as a parent, you never give up, even if you are not proud of how things went in the past.\nWith Jesus Christ, the Master Healer and Savior, there can always be a new beginning; He always gives hope.\nJesus Christ is the strength of families.\nJesus Christ is the strength of youth.\nJesus Christ is the strength of parents.\nOf this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

The guy\u2019s name is Bragg\u201d\u2014meaning \u201cto boast\u201d\u2014\u201cand he doesn\u2019t talk about humility? What a waste!\u201d Sadly, the disappointment continues.\n\nMy wonderful father was an All-America basketball player for UCLA under legendary Coach John Wooden. They remained close throughout my father\u2019s life, and occasionally Coach and Mrs. Wooden would come to our home for dinner. He was always happy to talk to me about basketball or anything else on my mind. Once I asked him what advice he had for me as I entered my senior year of high school. Always the teacher, he said, \u201cYour father told me that you have joined the Church of Jesus Christ, so I know that you have faith in the Lord. With that faith be sure to have poise in every situation. Be a good man in a storm.\u201d\nOver the years, that conversation stuck with me. That counsel to be calm, cool, and collected in all situations, particularly in times of adversity and pressure, resonated with me. I could see how Coach Wooden\u2019s teams played with poise and the great success that they experienced winning 10 national championships.\nBut poise is not spoken about much these days and practiced even less in turbulent and divisive times. It is often referenced in sports\u2014a player with poise is unflappable in a close game, or a team unravels due to a lack of poise. But this wonderful quality goes way beyond sports. Poise has a much broader application to life and can bless parents, leaders, missionaries, teachers, students, and everyone else facing the storms of life.\nSpiritual poise blesses us to stay calm and focused on what matters most, especially when we are under pressure. President Hugh&nbsp;B. Brown taught, \u201cFaith in God and in the ultimate triumph of right contributes to mental and spiritual poise in the face of difficulties.\u201d\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson is a wonderful example of spiritual poise. One time, while then-Dr. Nelson was performing a quadruple coronary artery bypass, the patient\u2019s blood pressure dropped suddenly. Dr. Nelson calmly assessed the situation and identified that a clamp was accidentally removed by one of the team members. It was replaced immediately, and Dr. Nelson comforted the team member, saying, \u201cI still love you,\u201d and then added jokingly, \u201cSometimes I love you more than other times!\u201d He showed how an emergency should be handled\u2014with poise, focused only on what matters most\u2014addressing the emergency. President Nelson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of extreme self-discipline. Your natural reaction is, \u2018Take me out, coach! I want to go home.\u2019 But of course you can\u2019t. A life is totally dependent on the whole surgical team. So you\u2019ve got to stay just as calm and relaxed and sharp as you ever were.\u201d\nOf course, the Savior is the ultimate example of poise.\nIn the Garden of Gethsemane, in unimaginable agony, as \u201che sweat as it were great drops of blood,\u201d He exemplified divine poise with the simple yet majestic statement \u201cNot my will, but thine, be done.\u201d Under the immense pressure to enable the salvation of all humankind, Jesus demonstrated three important conditions that help us understand His great poise. First, He knew who He was and was true to His divine mission. Next, He knew that there was a great plan of happiness. And finally, He knew that through His infinite Atonement, all who faithfully yoke themselves to Him by making and keeping sacred covenants received through priesthood ordinances will be saved, as was so beautifully taught by Elder Dale&nbsp;G. Renlund today.\nTo contrast the difference between losing and maintaining poise, think about what happened as Christ and His Apostles left the Garden of Gethsemane. When confronted by soldiers seeking to arrest Jesus, Peter\u2019s reaction was to lose his poise and lash out violently by cutting off the ear of the high priest\u2019s servant, Malchus. Jesus Christ\u2019s reaction, on the other hand, was to keep His poise and to bring calm to a tense situation by healing Malchus.\nAnd for those of us who struggle with maintaining our poise and perhaps have grown discouraged, consider the rest of Peter\u2019s story. A short time after this incident and the heartbreak of denying his association with Christ, Peter stood before the very same religious leaders who condemned the Savior, and with great poise under intense questioning, he bore eloquent testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ.\n\n\nKnow Who You Are and Be True to Your Divine Identity\n\nLet\u2019s consider elements of Christlike poise. To begin, knowing who we are and being true to our divine identity brings calm. Christlike poise requires that we avoid comparing ourselves to others or pretending to be someone we\u2019re not. Joseph Smith taught, \u201cIf men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves.\u201d It is just not possible to have divine poise without knowing that we are divine sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father.\nIn his talk \u201cChoices for Eternity,\u201d President Nelson taught these eternal truths about who we are: we are children of God, we are children of the covenant, and we are disciples of Christ. He then promised, \u201cAs you embrace these truths, our Heavenly Father will help you reach your ultimate goal of living eternally in His holy presence.\u201d We truly are divine spiritual beings having a mortal experience. Knowing who we are and being true to that divine identity are foundational to the development of Christlike poise.\n\n\n\nKnow That There Is a Divine Plan\n\nNext, remembering that there is a grand plan engenders courage and poise in challenging conditions. Nephi could \u201cgo and do\u201d as the Lord commanded \u201cnot knowing beforehand\u201d the things that he was to do because he knew that he would be led by the Spirit, in fulfillment of the eternal plan of a loving Heavenly Father. Poise comes when we see things from an eternal perspective. The Lord has counseled His disciples to \u201clift up your eyes\u201d and to \u201clet the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.\u201d By framing challenging times within an eternal plan, pressure becomes a privilege to love, serve, teach, and bless. An eternal view enables Christlike poise.\n\n\n\nKnow the Enabling Power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement\n\nAnd finally, the enabling power of Christ, made possible by His atoning sacrifice, gives us the strength to endure and prevail. Because of Jesus Christ we can covenant with God and be strengthened in keeping that covenant. We can be bound to the Savior in joy and calm, regardless of our temporal circumstances. [[Alma 7|Alma chapter 7]] teaches beautifully about Christ\u2019s enabling power. In addition to redeeming us from sin, the Savior can strengthen us in our weaknesses, fears, and challenges in this life.\nAs we focus on Christ, we can hush our fears, as Alma\u2019s people did in Helam. As a threatening army gathered, those faithful disciples of Christ demonstrated poise. Elder David&nbsp;A. Bednar has taught: \u201cAlma counseled the believers to remember the Lord and the deliverance only He could bestow (see 2&nbsp;Nephi 2:8). And knowledge of the Savior\u2019s protecting watchcare enabled the people to hush their own fears.\u201d This exemplifies poise.\n\n\n\nThe Great Man in a Storm\n\nNoah taught us much about patience in a storm, but the Savior was the greatest teacher on how to survive a storm. He is the great man in a storm. After a long day of teaching with His Apostles, the Savior needed some rest and suggested that they cross by boat to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. As the Savior rested, a severe storm arose. As the wind and waves threatened to sink the boat, the Apostles began to fear for their lives. And remember, several of those Apostles were fishermen who were very well acquainted with the storms on that sea! Yet, worried, they woke the Lord and asked, \u201c[Lord], carest thou not that we perish?\u201d Then, with exemplary poise, the Savior \u201carose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was \u2026 great calm.\u201d\nAnd then a great lesson in poise for His Apostles. He asked, \u201cWhy are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?\u201d He was reminding them that He was the Savior of the world and that He was sent by the Father to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of God\u2019s children. Surely the Son of God would not perish on a boat. He exemplified divine poise because He knew of His divinity and He knew that there was a plan of salvation and exaltation and how essential His Atonement would be to the eternal success of that plan.\nIt is through Christ and His Atonement that all good things come into our lives. As we remember who we are, knowing that there is a divine plan of mercy and drawing courage in the strength of the Lord, we can do all things. We will find calm. We will be good women and men in any storm.\nMay we seek the blessings of Christlike poise, not only to help ourselves in challenging times but to bless others and help them through the storms in their lives. On this eve of Palm Sunday, I joyfully testify of Jesus Christ. He is risen. I testify of the peace, calm, and heavenly poise that only He brings to our lives and do so in His holy name, Jesus Christ, amen.",

One time, while then-Dr. Nelson was performing a quadruple coronary artery bypass, the patient\u2019s blood pressure dropped suddenly. Dr. Nelson calmly assessed the situation and identified that a clamp was accidentally removed by one of the team members. It was replaced immediately, and Dr. Nelson comforted the team member, saying, \u201cI still love you,\u201d and then added jokingly, \u201cSometimes I love you more than other times!\u201d He showed how an emergency should be handled\u2014with poise, focused only on what matters most\u2014addressing the emergency. President Nelson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of extreme self-discipline. Your natural reaction is, \u2018Take me out, coach! I want to go home.\u2019 But of course you can\u2019t.

First, He knew who He was and was true to His divine mission. Next, He knew that there was a great plan of happiness. And finally, He knew that through His infinite Atonement, all who faithfully yoke themselves to Him by making and keeping sacred covenants received through priesthood ordinances will be saved, as was so beautifully taught by Elder Dale&nbsp;G. Renlund today."

Yet, worried, they woke the Lord and asked, \u201c[Lord], carest thou not that we perish?\u201d Then, with exemplary poise, the Savior \u201carose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.

        "full_markdown": "My father used to tell me, \u201cDon\u2019t focus so intensely on your problems that you can\u2019t see the solution.\u201d\nI testify that the Lord Jesus Christ is the solution to even our most difficult problems. Specifically, He has overcome four problems that every one of us faces and that not one of us can solve on our own:\n\n\nThe first problem is physical death. We can try to delay it or ignore it, but we can\u2019t overcome it on our own. Jesus Christ, however, overcame death for us, and as a consequence, we will all be resurrected one day.\n\n\nThe second problem includes the tribulations, difficult experiences, sadness, pain, and unfairness of this world. Jesus Christ overcame all of this. For those who strive to follow Him, He will one day \u201cwipe away all tears\u201d and make things right again. In the meantime, He can strengthen us to pass through our trials with confidence, good cheer, and peace.\n\n\nThe third problem is spiritual death arising from sin. Jesus Christ overcame this problem by taking upon Himself \u201cthe chastisement of our peace.\u201d Because of His atoning sacrifice, we can be freed from the consequences of our sins if we have faith in the Savior, sincerely repent, accept the covenant the Father offers us through essential ordinances such as baptism, and endure to the end.\n\n\nThe fourth problem is our limited, imperfect natures. Jesus Christ has the solution to this problem too. He doesn\u2019t just erase our errors and make us innocent again. He can work \u201ca mighty change in&nbsp;\u2026 our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.\u201d We can be perfected by the grace of Christ and one day become like Him.\n\n\nUnfortunately, too often we concentrate so much on our own problems that we lose focus on the solution, our Savior, Jesus Christ. How do we avoid that mistake? I believe the answer lies in the covenants we are invited to make with Him and our Father in Heaven.\n\n\nFocusing on Jesus Christ through Covenants\n\nOur covenants help us focus our attention, our thoughts, and our actions on Christ. As we \u201ccleave unto the covenants [we have] made,\u201d we can more easily identify \u201cthe things of this world\u201d that we should \u201clay aside\u201d and \u201cthe things of a better [world]\u201d we should diligently seek.\nThat\u2019s what the people of Ammon did in the Book of Mormon. As they learned of Jesus Christ and began to focus their lives on Him, they recognized that they should bury their weapons of war and became perfectly honest and \u201cdistinguished for their zeal towards God.\u201d\nCovenant keeping leads us to seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives it away\u2014\u201cfor we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.\u201d This may mean that we have to change our vocabulary, using kinder words. It could mean replacing spiritually unhealthy habits with new habits that strengthen our relationship with the Lord, such as daily prayer and scripture study, individually and with our family.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson said that \u201ceach person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples\u2014and keeps them\u2014has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cThe reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power\u2014power that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better.\u201d\nRenewing our covenants during the sacrament each Sunday is a great opportunity to examine ourselves and refocus our lives on Jesus Christ. By partaking of the sacrament, we declare that we do \u201calways remember him.\u201d The word *always* is so significant. It extends the Savior\u2019s influence into every part of our lives. We don\u2019t remember Him only at church or only during our morning prayers or only when we\u2019re in trouble and we need something.\nYes, we sometimes get distracted. We forget. We lose our focus. But renewing our covenants means that we *want* to always remember the Savior, that we will try to do so throughout the week, and that we will recommit and refocus on Him again at the sacrament table next week.\n\n\n\nFocusing on Jesus Christ in Our Homes\n\nClearly, focusing on Jesus Christ must be more than a Sunday, at-church activity. When President Nelson introduced *Come, Follow Me* in 2018, he said, \u201cIt is time for a *home-centered Church*.\u201d He said we should \u201ctransform [our] home into a sanctuary of faith\u201d and \u201ca center of gospel learning.\u201d And he made four wonderful promises to us if we do.\n*The first promise:* \u201c*Your* Sabbath days will truly be a delight.\u201d It will become a day when we draw closer to our Savior. As a young woman from Peru said, \u201cThe Lord\u2019s day is the day I get the most answers from the Lord.\u201d\n*The second promise:* \u201c*Your* children will be excited to learn and to live the Savior\u2019s teachings.\u201d That is why \u201cwe talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ,&nbsp;\u2026 that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\u201d\nWe do this so that one day, when our son goes out to work or to hike in the mountains or to hunt beasts in the forests, as Enos did, he may remember what we taught him about Christ and about the joy of living the gospel. And who knows? Maybe this will be the day when he will finally feel the spiritual hunger that turns him to Jesus Christ so he can hear the voice of the Lord saying to him, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.\u201d\n*The third promise:* \u201cThe influence of the adversary in *your* life and in *your* home will decrease.\u201d Why? Because the more we focus on Jesus Christ, the more sin loses its appeal. As our homes are filled with the Savior\u2019s light, there is less and less room for the darkness of the adversary.\n*The fourth promise:* \u201cChanges in your family will be dramatic and sustaining.\u201d Why? Because the change that Jesus Christ brings is \u201ca mighty change.\u201d He changes our very natures; we become \u201cnew creatures.\u201d We gradually become more like the Savior, filled with His pure love for all of God\u2019s children.\nWho wouldn\u2019t want these promises fulfilled in their lives and in their families? What do we need to do to obtain them? The answer is to transform our homes into a sanctuary of faith and a center of gospel learning. And how do we do that? By focusing on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, making Them the center of our family life, the most important influence in our home.\nCould I suggest that you begin by making the words of Christ, found in the scriptures, a daily part of your life? There is no prescribed formula for perfect scripture study. It could be 5 or 10 minutes each day\u2014or more if you can. It could be a chapter or a few verses a day. Some families prefer to study in the morning before they leave for school or work. Others prefer to read at night before bed. Some young couples have told me that they study individually on the way to work and then share insights with each other via text so their comments and discussions are recorded.\n*Come, Follow Me* provides many suggestions of activities and resources that can help individuals and families learn gospel principles from the scriptures. The Bible videos and the Book of Mormon videos can also be valuable tools to make the scriptures more accessible to your family. Youth and children are often inspired by the memorable stories in the scriptures. These stories and the gospel principles they teach will stay with your children, like trusted friends, when they need good examples of service, virtue, obedience, patience, perseverance, personal revelation, charity, humility, and faith in Jesus Christ. Over time, your consistency in feasting on the word of God will help your children grow closer and closer to the Savior. They will come to know Him as never before.\nThe Lord Jesus Christ lives today. He can be an active, daily presence in our lives. He is the solution to our problems, but we must lift our eyes and raise our sights to see Him. He has said, \u201cLook unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.\u201d As we focus on Him and our Father in Heaven, make and keep covenants with Them, and make Them the most important influence in our home and family, we will become the kind of people President Nelson envisioned: \u201cA people who are able, ready, and worthy to receive the Lord when He comes again, a people who have already chosen Jesus Christ over this fallen world, a people who rejoice in their agency to live the higher, holier laws of Jesus Christ.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Several years ago, Sister Nattress and I moved to Idaho, where we opened a new business. There were long days and nights at the office. Thankfully, we lived just a few blocks away from work. Each week, Shawna and our three daughters\u2014all under the age of six\u2014would come to the office to share lunch together.\nOn one such day after our family lunch, I noticed that our five-year-old daughter, Michelle, had left me a personal message, written on a Post-it Note and attached to my office telephone.\nIt simply read, \u201cDad, remember to love me. Love, Michelle.\u201d This was a powerful reminder to a young father about those things that matter most.\nBrothers and sisters, I testify that *our Heavenly Father always remembers us* and that He loves us perfectly. My question is this: Do we remember Him? And do we love Him?\nYears ago, I served as a local Church leader. One of our young men, Danny, was outstanding in every way. He was obedient, kind, good, and had a great heart. However, when he graduated from high school, he started to associate with a rough crowd. He got involved in drugs, specifically methamphetamine, and traveled down the slippery slope of addiction and destruction. Before long, his appearance completely changed. He was hardly recognizable. The most significant change was in his eyes\u2014the light in his eyes had dimmed. Several times I reached out to him, but to no avail. He wasn\u2019t interested.\nIt was difficult to see this incredible young man suffer and live a life that was not him! He was capable of so much more.\nThen one day, his miracle began.\nHe attended a sacrament meeting where his younger brother shared his testimony prior to departing for a mission. During the meeting, Danny felt something he had not felt for a long time. He felt the love of the Lord. He finally had hope.\nAlthough he had a desire to change, it was difficult for Danny. His addictions and the accompanying guilt were almost more than he could bear.\nOne particular afternoon, when I was out mowing our lawn, Danny pulled up in his car unannounced. He was struggling terribly. I turned off the mower, and we sat down together in the shade of the front porch. It was then that he shared the feelings of his heart. He truly wanted to come back. However, turning away from his addictions and lifestyle was extremely difficult. Adding to this, he felt so guilty, so ashamed for falling so far. He asked, \u201cCan I really be forgiven? Is there really a way back?\u201d\nAfter he poured out his heart with these concerns, we read [[Alma 36|Alma chapter 36]] together:\n\u201cYea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cYea, \u2026 the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror\u201d ([[Alma 36|verses 13\u201314]]).\nAfter those verses, Danny said, \u201cThis is exactly how I feel!\u201d\nWe continued:\n\u201cWhile I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold\u201d ([[Alma 36|verses 17, 20]]).\nAs we read these passages, tears began to flow. Alma\u2019s joy was the joy he had been searching for!\nWe discussed that Alma had been exceptionally wicked. However, once he repented, he never looked back. He became a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ. He became a prophet! Danny\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cA prophet?\u201d he said.\nI simply responded, \u201cYes, a prophet. No pressure on you!\u201d\nWe discussed that while his sins did not rise to the level of Alma\u2019s, the same promise of complete and perfect forgiveness is made to everyone\u2014in and through the infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ.\nDanny now understood. He knew what he needed to do: he needed to begin his journey by trusting in the Lord and forgiving himself!\nDanny\u2019s mighty change of heart was nothing short of a miracle. Over time, his countenance changed, and the brightness in his eyes returned. He became temple worthy! He was finally back!\nAfter several months, I asked Danny if he would like to submit an application to serve a full-time mission. His response was one of shock and awe.\nHe said, \u201cI would love to serve a mission, but you know where I have been and the things I have done! I thought I was disqualified.\u201d\nI responded, \u201cYou may be right. However, there is nothing precluding us from making a request. If you are excused, at least you will know that you expressed a sincere desire to serve the Lord.\u201d His eyes lit up. He was thrilled with this idea. To him this was a long shot, but it was a chance he was willing to take.\nA few weeks later, and to his amazement, another miracle occurred. Danny received a call to serve a full-time mission.\nA few months after Danny arrived in the mission field, I received a telephone call. His president simply said, \u201cWhat is it with this young man? He is the most incredible missionary I have ever seen!\u201d You see, this president had received a modern-day Alma the Younger.\nTwo years later, Danny returned home with honor, having served the Lord with all his heart, might, mind, and strength.\nFollowing his missionary report in sacrament meeting, I returned home, only to hear a knock at the front door. There stood Danny with tears welling in his eyes. He said, \u201cCan we talk for a minute?\u201d We went outside to the same porch step.\nHe said, \u201cPresident, do you think I have truly been forgiven?\u201d\nNow my tears accompanied his. Before me stood a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ who had given his all to teaching and testifying about the Savior. He was the embodiment of the healing and strengthening power of the Savior\u2019s Atonement.\nI said, \u201cDanny! Have you looked in the mirror? Have you seen your eyes? They are filled with light, and you are beaming with the Spirit of the Lord. Of course you have been forgiven! You are amazing! Now what you need to do is move forward with your life. Don\u2019t look back! Look forward with faith to the next ordinance.\u201d\nDanny\u2019s miracle continues today. He married in the temple and returned to school, where he received a master\u2019s degree. He continues to serve the Lord with honor and dignity in his callings. More important, he has become an incredible husband and a faithful father. He is a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught, \u201cWithout the [Savior\u2019s] infinite Atonement, all mankind would be irretrievably lost.\u201d Danny wasn\u2019t lost, and neither are we to the Lord. He stands at the door to lift us, to strengthen us, and to forgive us. He always remembers to love us!\nAn incredible demonstration of the Savior\u2019s love for God\u2019s children is recorded in the Book of Mormon: \u201cWhen Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them\u201d ([[3 Nephi 17|3&nbsp;Nephi 17:5]]).\nThe Savior had already spent a full day ministering to the people. Yet He had more to do\u2014He was to visit His other sheep; He was to go to His Father.\nNotwithstanding these obligations, He discerned that the people desired for Him to tarry a little longer. Then, with the Savior\u2019s heart full of compassion, one of the greatest miracles in the history of the world occurred:\nHe stayed.\nHe blessed them.\nHe ministered to their children one by one.\nHe prayed for them; He wept with them.\nAnd He healed them. (See [[3 Nephi 17|3&nbsp;Nephi 17]].)\nHis promise is eternal: He will heal us.\nTo those who have strayed from the covenant path, please know there is always hope, there is always healing, and there is always a way back.\nHis eternal message of hope is the healing balm for all who live in a troubled world. The Savior said, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life\u201d ([[John 14|John 14:6]]).\nBrothers and sisters, let us remember to seek Him, to love Him, and to always remember Him.\nI testify that God lives and that He loves us. I further testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the world. He is the mighty healer. I know that my Redeemer lives! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "The Lord Jesus Christ said:\n\u201cI am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAs the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.\u201d\nIn the Greek version of this scripture, the word for *good* also means \u201cbeautiful, magnificent.\u201d So today, I wish to speak of the Good Shepherd, the Beautiful Shepherd, the Magnificent Shepherd, even Jesus Christ.\nIn the New Testament, He is called the \u201cgreat shepherd,\u201d the \u201cchief Shepherd,\u201d and \u201cthe Shepherd and Bishop of [our] souls.\u201d\nIn the Old Testament, Isaiah wrote that \u201che shall feed his flock like a shepherd.\u201d\nIn the Book of Mormon, He is called \u201cthe good shepherd\u201d and the \u201cgreat and true shepherd.\u201d\n\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants, He declares, \u201cWherefore, I am in your midst, and I am the good shepherd.\u201d\nIn our day, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has declared: \u201cThe Good Shepherd lovingly cares for all sheep of His fold, and we are His true undershepherds. Our privilege is to bear His love and to add our own love to friends and neighbors\u2014feeding, tending, and nurturing them\u2014as the Savior would have us do.\u201d\nMore recently, President Nelson has said: \u201cA hallmark of the Lord\u2019s true and living Church will always be an organized, directed effort to minister to individual children of God and their families. Because it is His Church, we as His servants will minister to the one, just as He did. We will minister in His name, with His power and authority, and with His loving-kindness.\u201d\nWhen the Pharisees and scribes murmured against the Lord, \u201csaying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them,\u201d He responded by presenting three beautiful stories that we have come to know as the parable of the lost sheep, the parable of the lost coin, and the parable of the prodigal son.\nIt is interesting to note that when Luke, the Gospel writer, is introducing the three stories, he uses the word *parable* in the singular, not in the plural. It appears that the Lord is teaching one unique lesson with three stories\u2014stories that present different numbers: 100 sheep, 10 coins, and 2 sons.\nThe key number in each of these stories, however, is the number *one*. And a lesson we might take from that number is that you might be an undershepherd for 100 elders and prospective elders in your elders quorum or an adviser to 10 young women or a teacher to 2 Primary children, but you always, always minister to them, care for them, and love them one by one, individually. You never say, \u201cWhat a foolish sheep\u201d or \u201cAfter all, I do not really need that coin\u201d or \u201cWhat a rebellious son he is.\u201d If you and I have with us \u201cthe pure love of Christ,\u201d we, as the man in the story of the lost sheep, will \u201cleave the ninety and nine \u2026 and go after that which is lost, until [\u2026 until \u2026 until we] find it.\u201d Or, as the woman in the story of the lost coin, we will \u201clight a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently [\u2026 diligently] till [\u2026 till \u2026 till we] find it.\u201d If we have with us \u201cthe pure love of Christ,\u201d we will follow the example of the father in the story of the prodigal son, who, when the son \u201cwas yet a great way off, \u2026 saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\u201d\nCan we feel the urgency in the heart of the man who lost only one sheep? Or the urgency in the heart of the woman who lost just one coin? Or the ineffable love and compassion in the heart of the prodigal\u2019s father?\nMy wife, Maria Isabel, and I served in Central America, being stationed in Guatemala City. There I had the opportunity to meet Julia, a faithful member of the Church. I had the impression to ask her about her family. Her mother died of cancer in 2011. Her father had been a faithful leader in his stake, serving as a bishop and as a counselor to his stake president for several years. He was a true undershepherd of the Lord. Julia told me of his tireless efforts to visit, to minister, and to serve. He indeed rejoiced in feeding and tending the precious sheep of the Lord. He remarried and stayed active in the Church.\nA few years later, he went through a divorce, and now he had to attend church alone once again. He felt out of place and also felt that some people were critical of him because of his divorce. He stopped attending church as a negative spirit filled his heart.\nJulia spoke highly of this wonderful undershepherd, who was a hardworking, loving, and compassionate man. I vividly remember that a feeling of urgency came to me as she was describing him. I just wanted to do something for that man, a man who had done so much for so many throughout those years.\nShe gave me his cell phone number, and I began calling him, hoping to have the chance to meet with him personally. After several weeks and many, many phone calls without success, one day he finally answered the phone.\nI told him that I had met Julia, his daughter, and that I was captivated by the way he had served, ministered, and loved the precious sheep of the Lord for so many years. He was not expecting a comment like that. I told him that I really wanted to visit with him eye to eye, face to face. He asked me my purpose in proposing such a meeting. I replied, \u201cI really want to meet the father of such a wonderful lady.\u201d Then for a few seconds there was silence over the phone\u2014a few seconds that seemed to me like an eternity. He simply said, \u201cWhen and where?\u201d\nThe day I met him, I invited him to share with me some of his experiences visiting, ministering, and serving the precious sheep of the Lord. As he was recounting some touching stories, I noticed that the tone of his voice changed and the same spirit he had felt so many times as an undershepherd came back. Now his eyes were filled with tears. I knew this was the right moment for me, but I found that I did not know what to say. I prayed in my mind, \u201cFather, help me.\u201d\nSuddenly, I heard myself saying, \u201cBrother Florian, as a servant of the Lord, I apologize for our not being there for you. Please, forgive us. Give us another chance to show you that we do love you. That we need you. That you are important to us.\u201d\nThe following Sunday he was back. He had a long conversation with his bishop and remained active. A few months later he passed away\u2014but he had come back. He had come back. I testify that with our Savior\u2019s help, we can love His precious sheep and minister to them as He would. And so, there in Guatemala City the Lord Jesus Christ brought back one more precious sheep into His fold. And He taught me a lesson on ministering that I cannot forget. In the name of the Good Shepherd, the Beautiful Shepherd, the Magnificent Shepherd, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.",

Oaks has noted, today is Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week, marking the Lord\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, His suffering in Gethsemane and death on the cross just days later, and His glorious Resurrection on Easter Sunday. Let us resolve never to forget what Christ endured to redeem us. And let us never lose the overwhelming joy we will feel once again on Easter as we contemplate His victory over the grave and the gift of universal resurrection.\nThe evening before the trials and crucifixion that awaited Him, Jesus joined in a Passover meal with His Apostles. At the end of this Last Supper, in a sacred Intercessory Prayer, Jesus petitioned His Father in these words: \u201cHoly Father, keep through thine own name [mine Apostles] whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.\u201d\nThen, tenderly, the Savior expanded His petition to include all believers:\n\u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;\n\u201cThat they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.\u201d\nBecoming one is a recurring theme in the gospel of Jesus Christ and in God\u2019s dealings with His children. With respect to the city of Zion in Enoch\u2019s day, it is said that \u201cthey were of one heart and one mind.\u201d Of the early Saints in the primitive Church of Jesus Christ, the New Testament records, \u201cThe multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.\u201d\nIn our own dispensation, the Lord admonished, \u201cI say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.\u201d Among the reasons the Lord gave as to why the early Saints in Missouri had failed to establish a place of Zion was that they \u201care not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom.\u201d\nWhere God prevails in all hearts and minds, the people are described as \u201c*in one*, the children of Christ.\u201d\nWhen the resurrected Savior appeared to the ancient Book of Mormon peoples, He noted with disapproval that in the past there had been disputations among the people about baptism and other matters. He commanded:\n\u201cThere shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.\n\n\u201cFor verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention.\u201d\nIn our extremely contentious world, how can unity be achieved, especially in the Church, where we are to have \u201cone Lord, one faith, one baptism\u201d? Paul gives us the key:\n\u201cFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.\n\u201cThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ.\u201d\nWe are too diverse and at times too discordant to be able to come together as one on any other basis or under any other name. Only in Jesus Christ can we truly become one.\nBecoming one in Christ happens one by one\u2014we each begin with ourselves. We are dual beings of flesh and spirit and are sometimes at war within ourselves. As Paul expressed:\n\u201cFor I delight in the law of God after the inward man;\n\u201cBut I see another law in [the] members [of my body], warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.\u201d\nJesus was also a being of flesh and spirit. He was tested; He understands; He can help us achieve unity within. Therefore, drawing upon the light and the grace of Christ, we strive to give our spirit\u2014and the Holy Spirit\u2014dominance over the physical. And when we fall short, Christ, by His Atonement, has given us the gift of repentance and the opportunity to try again.\nIf individually we each \u201cput on Christ,\u201d then together we can hope to become one, as Paul said, \u201cthe body of Christ.\u201d To \u201cput on Christ\u201d certainly includes making His \u201cfirst and great commandment\u201d our first and greatest commitment, and if we love God, we will keep His commandments.\nUnity with our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ grows as we heed the second commandment\u2014inextricably connected to the first\u2014to love others as ourselves. And I suppose an even more perfect unity would obtain among us if we followed the Savior\u2019s higher and holier expression of this second commandment\u2014to love one another not only as we love ourselves but as *He* loved us. In sum, it is \u201cevery man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.\u201d\nPresident Marion&nbsp;G. Romney, a former counselor in the First Presidency, in explaining how enduring peace and unity are obtained, said:\n\u201cIf a single person, yielding to Satan, is filled with the works of the flesh, he wars within himself. If two yield, they each war within themselves and fight with each other. If many people yield, a society [reaps] the harvest of great stress and contention. If the rulers of a country yield, there is world-wide contention.\u201d\nPresident Romney continued: \u201cAs the works of the flesh have universal application, so likewise does the gospel of peace. If one man lives it, he has peace within himself. If two men live it, they each have peace within themselves and with each other. If the citizens live it, the nation has domestic peace. When there are enough nations enjoying the fruit of the Spirit to control world affairs, then, and only then, will the war-drums throb no longer, and the battle flags be furl\u2019d. \u2026 (See Alfred Lord Tennyson, \u201cLocksley Hall,\u201d The Complete Poetical Works of Tennyson, ed. W.&nbsp;J. Rolfe, Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 1898, p. 93, lines 27\u201328.)\u201d\nWhen we \u201cput on Christ,\u201d it becomes possible either to resolve or to lay aside differences, disagreements, and disputes. A rather dramatic example of overcoming division is found in our Church history. Elder Brigham Henry Roberts (commonly known as B.&nbsp;H. Roberts), born in England in 1857, served as a member of the First Council of the Seventy\u2014what we refer to today as the Presidency of the Seventy. Elder Roberts was an able and tireless defender of the restored gospel and of the Church in some of its most difficult times.\n\nIn 1895, however, Elder Roberts\u2019s service in the Church was put in jeopardy by contention. B.&nbsp;H. had been appointed as a delegate to the convention that drafted a constitution for Utah when it became a state. Afterward, he decided to become a candidate for the United States Congress but did not notify or seek permission from the First Presidency. President Joseph&nbsp;F. Smith, a counselor in the First Presidency, censured B.&nbsp;H. for that failure in a general priesthood meeting. Elder Roberts lost the election and felt his defeat was due in large part to President Smith\u2019s statements. He was critical of Church leaders in some political speeches and interviews. He withdrew from active Church service. In a lengthy meeting in the Salt Lake Temple with members of the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve, B.&nbsp;H. remained adamant in justifying himself. Later, \u201cPresident [Wilford] Woodruff gave [Elder Roberts] three weeks to reconsider his position. If he remained unrepentant, they would release him from the Seventy.\u201d\nIn a subsequent private meeting with Apostles Heber&nbsp;J. Grant and Francis Lyman, B.&nbsp;H. was initially unyielding, but love and the Holy Spirit ultimately prevailed. Tears came to his eyes. The two Apostles were able to respond to certain perceived slights and offenses that troubled B.&nbsp;H., and they left with a heartfelt plea for reconciliation. The next morning, after lengthy prayer, Elder Roberts sent a note to Elders Grant and Lyman that he was prepared to reunite with his brethren.\nWhen he later met with the First Presidency, Elder Roberts said, \u201cI went to the Lord and received light and instruction through His Spirit to submit to the authority of God.\u201d Motivated by his love of God, B.&nbsp;H. Roberts remained a faithful and an able Church leader to the end of his life.\n\nWe can also see in this example that unity does not mean simply agreeing that everyone should do his or her own thing or go his or her own way. We cannot be one unless we all bend our efforts to the common cause. It means, in B.&nbsp;H. Roberts\u2019s words, submitting to the authority of God. We are different members of the body of Christ, fulfilling different functions at different times\u2014the ear, the eye, the head, the hand, the feet\u2014yet all of one body. Therefore, our goal is \u201cthat there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.\u201d\nUnity does not require sameness, but it does require harmony. We can have our hearts knit together in love, be one in faith and doctrine, and still cheer for different teams, disagree on various political issues, debate about goals and the right way to achieve them, and many other such things. But we can never disagree or contend with anger or contempt for one another. Said the Savior:\n\u201cFor verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.\n\u201cBehold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.\u201d\nA year ago, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson pled with us in these words: \u201cNone of us can control nations or the actions of others or even members of our own families. But we can control ourselves. My call today, dear brothers and sisters, is to end conflicts that are raging in *your* heart, *your* home, and *your* life. Bury any and all inclinations to hurt others\u2014whether those inclinations be a temper, a sharp tongue, or a resentment for someone who has hurt you. The Savior commanded us to turn the other cheek [see [[3 Nephi 12|3&nbsp;Nephi 12:39]]], to love our enemies, and to pray for those who despitefully use us [see [[3 Nephi 12|3&nbsp;Nephi 12:44]]].\u201d\nI say again that it is only in and through our individual loyalty to and love of Jesus Christ that we can hope to be one\u2014one within, one at home, one in the Church, eventually one in Zion, and above all, one with the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.\nI return to the events of Holy Week and the ultimate triumph of our Redeemer. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ bears witness of His divinity and that He has overcome all things. His Resurrection bears witness that, bound to Him by covenant, we too may overcome all things and become one. His Resurrection bears witness that through Him, immortality and eternal life are realities.\nThis morning, I bear witness of His literal Resurrection and all that it implies, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

They were innovative in getting him there\u2014uncovering the roof and lowering the man, on his bed, to the place where Jesus was teaching. When Jesus \u201csaw their faith, he said [to the man with palsy], thy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d And then, \u201cArise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.\u201d And immediately the man with palsy arose and took his bed and departed for home, \u201cglorifying God.\u201d\nWhat more do we know of the friends who provided care for the man with palsy? We know that the Savior recognized *their* faith. And having seen and heard the Savior and being a witness to His miracles, they were \u201camazed\u201d and \u201cglorified God.\u201d\nJesus Christ had provided the hoped-for healing\u2014physical *relief* from pain and the crippling consequences of chronic disease. Significantly, the Savior also provided spiritual *relief* in cleansing the man from sin.\nAnd the friends\u2014in their efforts to care for one in need, they found the source of relief; they found Jesus Christ.\nI testify that Jesus Christ *is* relief. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we may be relieved of the burden and consequences of sin and be succored in our infirmities.\nAnd because we love God and have covenanted to serve Him, we can partner with the Savior to help provide temporal and spiritual relief for those in need\u2014and in the process find our own relief in Jesus Christ.\nOur beloved prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, invited us to overcome the world and find rest. He defined \u201ctrue rest\u201d as \u201crelief and peace.\u201d President Nelson said, \u201cBecause the Savior, through His infinite Atonement, redeemed each of us from weakness, mistakes, and sin, and because He experienced every pain, worry, and burden you have ever had, then as you truly repent and seek His help, you can rise above this present precarious world.\u201d That is the relief Jesus Christ offers us!\nEach of us is carrying a metaphorical backpack. It may be a basket balanced on your head or a satchel or a bundle of things wrapped in cloth and thrown over your shoulder. But for our thinking, let\u2019s call it a backpack.\nThis metaphorical backpack is where we carry the burdens of living in a fallen world. Our burdens are like rocks in the backpack. Generally, there are three kinds:\n\n\nRocks there of our own doing because of sin.\n\n\nRocks in our backpack because of the poor decisions, misconduct, and unkindness of others.\n\n\nAnd rocks we carry because we are living in a fallen condition. These include the rocks of disease, pain, chronic illness, grief, disappointment, loneliness, and the effects of natural disasters.\n\n\n\nI joyfully declare that our mortal burdens, these rocks in our figurative backpack, need not feel heavy.\nJesus Christ can lighten our load.\nJesus Christ can lift our burdens.\nJesus Christ provides a way for us to be relieved of the weight of sin.\nJesus Christ is our relief.\nHe said:\n\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest [that is, relief and peace].\n\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d\nThat the yoke is easy and the burden is light presumes we get in the yoke with the Savior, that we share our burdens with Him, that we let Him lift our load. That means entering into a covenant relationship with God and keeping that covenant, which, as President Nelson has explained, \u201cmakes *everything* about life easier.\u201d He said, \u201cYoking yourself with the Savior means you have access to *His* strength and redeeming power.\u201d\nSo why are we stingy with our rocks? Why would a weary baseball pitcher refuse to leave the mound when a reliever is there ready to complete the game? Why would I insist on maintaining my post alone when the Reliever stands ready to keep it with me?\nPresident Nelson has taught, \u201cJesus Christ \u2026 stands with open arms, hoping and willing to heal, forgive, cleanse, strengthen, purify, and sanctify us.\u201d\nSo why do we insist on carrying our rocks alone?\nIt is intended as a personal question for each of you to consider.\nFor me, it is the age-old vice of pride. \u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d I say. \u201cNo worries; I\u2019ll get it done.\u201d It\u2019s the great deceiver who wants me to hide from God, to turn away from Him, to go at it alone.\nBrothers and sisters, I can\u2019t go at it alone, and I don\u2019t need to, and I won\u2019t. Choosing to be bound to my Savior, Jesus Christ, through the covenants I have made with God, \u201cI can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\u201d\nCovenant keepers are blessed with the Savior\u2019s relief.\nConsider this example in the Book of Mormon: The people of Alma were persecuted with \u201ctasks upon them, and \u2026 task-masters over them.\u201d Forbidden to pray vocally, they \u201cdid pour out their hearts to [God]; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.\u201d\nAnd \u201cthe voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the *covenant* which ye have made unto me; and I will *covenant* with my people and deliver them out of bondage.\n\u201cAnd I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs.\u201d\nAnd their burdens \u201cwere made light,\u201d and \u201cthe Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.\u201d\nThose covenant keepers received relief in the form of comfort, increased patience and cheerfulness, an ease in their burdens so that they felt light, and ultimately deliverance.\nNow let\u2019s return to our own metaphorical backpack.\nRepentance, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, is what relieves us of the weight of the rocks of sin. And by this exquisite gift, God\u2019s mercy relieves us from the heavy and otherwise insurmountable demands of justice.\nThe Atonement of Jesus Christ also makes it possible for us to receive strength to forgive, which allows us to unload the weight we carry because of mistreatment by others.\nSo how does the Savior relieve us of the burdens of living in a fallen world with mortal bodies subject to grief and pain?\n\nOften, He performs that kind of relief through us! As covenant members of His Church, we promise \u201cto mourn with those that mourn\u201d and \u201ccomfort those that stand in need of comfort.\u201d Because we are \u201ccome into the fold of God\u201d and are \u201ccalled his people,\u201d we \u201care willing to bear one another\u2019s burdens, that they may be light.\u201d\nOur covenantal blessing is to partner with Jesus Christ in providing relief, both temporal and spiritual, to all of God\u2019s children. We are a conduit through which He provides relief.\nAnd so, like the friends of the man with palsy, we \u201csuccor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.\u201d We \u201cbear \u2026 one another\u2019s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.\u201d As we do, we come to know Him, become like Him, and find His relief.\nWhat is relief?\nIt is the removal or lightening of something painful, troubling, or burdensome, or the strength to endure it. It refers to a person who takes the place of another. It is the legal correction of a wrong. The Anglo-French word comes from Old French, the word *relever*, or \u201cto raise up,\u201d and from the Latin *relevare*, or \u201craise again.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, Jesus Christ is relief. I testify that He did rise again on the third day and, having fulfilled the loving and infinite Atonement, stands with open arms, offering to us the opportunity to rise again, be saved, *and* be exalted and become like Him. The relief He offers us is everlasting.\nLike the women visited by the angel on that first Easter morning, I wish to \u201cgo quickly\u201d and with \u201cgreat joy\u201d to bring the word that He is risen. In the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.",

Snow, its secretary who later served as the second president of the Relief Society, explained that *benevolent* was a popular word\u2014popular with the institutions of the day\u2014but that popular \u201cshould not be our guide.\u201d Emma expounded that the word *relief* better described their mission. \u201cWe are going to do something extraordinary \u2026 we expect extraordinary occasions and pressing calls\u201d (Emma Smith, in Nauvoo Relief Society Minute Book, Mar.&nbsp;17, 1842, 12, josephsmithpapers.org). Indeed, the mandate of Relief Society has always been to provide temporal and spiritual relief. Joseph Smith taught, \u201cThe Society is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls\u201d (in Nauvoo Relief Society Minute Book, June&nbsp;9, 1842, 63, josephsmithpapers.org). And so the Relief Society continues to provide relief: \u201cRelief of poverty, relief of illness; relief of doubt, relief of ignorance\u2014relief of all that hinders the joy and progress of woman\u201d (John&nbsp;A. Widtsoe, Evidences and Reconciliations, arr. G.&nbsp;Homer Durham, 3 vols. in 1 [1960], 308)."

        "full_markdown": "In fulfillment of the prophecy given to Zechariah, Jesus triumphantly entered the Holy City riding upon a donkey, which was considered in literature an \u201cancient symbol of Jewish royalty,\u201d as indeed befitted the King of kings and Prince of Peace. He was surrounded by a multitude of jubilant disciples who spread out their garments, palm leaves, and other foliage along the path where Jesus passed. They praised God, saying with a loud voice, \u201cBlessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.\u201d And again, \u201cHosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.\u201d This majestic event, which we celebrate on this day known as Palm Sunday, was a joyful prelude to the excruciating events that would occur during that fateful week culminating in the Savior\u2019s selfless sacrifice and the magnificent miracle of the empty tomb.\nAs His followers, we are His peculiar people, called to proclaim His virtues, promoters of the peace so generously offered through Him and His atoning sacrifice. This peace is a gift promised to all who turn their hearts to the Savior and live righteously; such peace gives us the strength to enjoy mortal life and enables us to endure the painful trials of our journey.\nIn 1847, the Lord gave specific instructions to the pioneer Saints, who needed peace to remain calm and united as they faced unexpected difficulties on their westward journey. Among other things, the Lord instructed the Saints to \u201ccease to contend one with another; cease to speak evil one of another.\u201d The scriptures affirm that those who practice works of righteousness and strive to walk in the meekness of the Spirit of the Lord are promised the peace they need to survive the days of commotion in which we live today.\nAs disciples of the Prince of Peace, we have been instructed to live with \u201chearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.\u201d Our beloved prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, recently stated, \u201cContention violates everything the Savior stood for and taught.\u201d Our prophet also implored that we do all we can to end personal conflicts that are currently raging in our hearts and in our lives.\nLet us consider these principles in view of Christ\u2019s pure love for us that we, as His followers, seek to have for one another. The scriptures define this kind of love as charity. When we think of charity, our minds usually turn to generous acts and donations to relieve the suffering of those who are experiencing physical, material, or emotional difficulties. Still, charity is not only related to something we donate to someone, but it\u2019s an attribute of the Savior and can become part of our character. It is not surprising that the Lord instructed us to clothe ourselves \u201cwith the bond of charity, \u2026 which is the bond of perfectness and peace.\u201d Without charity, we are nothing and we cannot inherit the place the Lord has prepared for us in the mansions of our Heavenly Father.\nJesus perfectly exemplified what it means to own this bond of perfection and peace, especially when facing the agonizing events that preceded His martyrdom. Think for a moment about what Jesus must have felt as He humbly washed His disciples\u2019 feet, knowing that one of them would betray Him that very night. Or when Jesus, hours later, mercifully healed the ear of one of the men who had accompanied Judas, His betrayer, to arrest Him. Or even when the Savior, standing in front of Pilate, was unfairly accused by the chief priests and elders, and not a word He uttered against the false charges against Him, and He left the Roman governor marveling.\nThrough these three tragic incidents, the Savior, despite being burdened with excessive sadness and stress, taught us by His example that \u201ccharity suffereth long, and is kind; \u2026 envieth not; \u2026 vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, [and] thinketh no evil.\u201d\nAnother important aspect to emphasize, and one that has direct implications on our discipleship and how we promote the peace of the Savior, is the manner in which we treat each other. During His earthly ministry, the Savior\u2019s teachings focused\u2014not only, but particularly\u2014on the virtues of love, charity, patience, humility, and compassion\u2014fundamental attributes to those who want to become closer to Him and promote His peace. Such attributes are gifts from God, and as we strive to develop them, we will begin to see our neighbor\u2019s differences and weaknesses with more empathy, sensitivity, respect, and tolerance. One of the most evident signs that we are drawing closer to the Savior and becoming more like Him is the loving, patient, and kind way with which we treat our fellow beings, whatever the circumstances.\nWe often see people who engage in negative and even derogatory comments about the perceived characteristics, weaknesses, and opinions of others, mainly when such characteristics and opinions differ or contradict how they act and think. It is very common to see these people passing on such comments to others, who repeat what they heard without truly knowing all the circumstances surrounding a situation. Unfortunately, social media encourages this kind of behavior in the name of relative truths and transparency. Without restraint, digital conversation often leads people to personal attacks and heated disputes, creating disappointments, wounding hearts, and spreading flaming hostility.\n\nNephi prophesied that in the latter days, the enemy would rage and stir up people to anger against what is good. The scriptures teach that \u201cevery thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cthat which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.\u201d\nConsidering this prophetic teaching, it is not surprising that one of the adversary\u2019s tactics is to stir up enmity and hate in the hearts of God\u2019s children. He rejoices when he sees people criticizing, ridiculing, and slandering one another. This behavior can destroy a person\u2019s character, reputation, and self-esteem, particularly when the person is judged unfairly. It is critical to point out that when we allow this type of attitude in our lives, we make room in our hearts for the enemy to plant the seed of discord among us, risking falling into his voracious trap.\nIf we are not careful with our thoughts, words, and actions, we may end up being entangled by the cunning tricks of the enemy, destroying our relationships with the people around us and our loved ones.\nBrothers and sisters, as the Lord\u2019s peculiar people and promoters of His peace, we cannot afford to allow these tricks of the evil one to take place in our hearts. We cannot carry such a corrosive burden that destroys feelings, relationships, and even lives. The gospel represents good tidings of great joy.\nOf course, none of us is perfect, and certainly there are times when we are beguiled into this type of behavior. In His perfect love and omniscient knowledge of our human tendencies, the Savior always tries to warn us of such dangers. He taught us, \u201cFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\u201d\nMy dear brothers and sisters, as we strive to develop attributes like the Savior\u2019s, we can become instruments of His peace in the world according to the pattern that He Himself established. I invite you to consider ways we can transform ourselves into uplifting and supportive people, people who have an understanding and forgiving heart, people who look for the best in others, always remembering that \u201cif there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\u201d\nI promise you that as we pursue and develop these attributes, we will become more and more cordial and sensitive to the needs of our fellow beings and will experience joy, peace, and spiritual growth. Undoubtedly, the Lord will recognize our efforts and give us the gifts we need to be more tolerant and patient with one another\u2019s differences, weaknesses, and imperfections. Furthermore, we will be better able to resist the urge to take offense or offend those who hurt us. Our desire to forgive, as the Savior did, those who mistreat us or speak evil about us will surely increase and will become part of our character.\nMay we today, on this Palm Sunday, spread out our robes of love and palm leaves of charity, walking in the footsteps of the Prince of Peace as we prepare to celebrate, this coming Sunday, the miracle of the empty tomb. As brothers and sisters in Christ, let us joyfully proclaim, \u201cHosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.\u201d\nI testify that Jesus Christ lives and that His perfect love, expressed through His atoning sacrifice, is extended to all who desire to walk with Him and enjoy His peace in this world and in the world to come. I say these things in the holy name of the Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Yesterday my dear friend Elder Randall&nbsp;K. Bennett talked about patriarchal blessings. It was a great message and inspired us all. My dear brothers and sisters, may I talk about patriarchal blessings as well? Patriarchs, as requests for patriarchal blessings may increase, I pray that the Lord will bless you as you continue to magnify your calling.\nAs I go to stake conferences, I always visit with the stake patriarch and his spouse. Patriarchs are gentle, obedient, and incredible leaders called of God. They tell me many wonderful spiritual experiences. I ask them the age of the youngest and the oldest person to whom they have given a blessing. So far the youngest was 11, and the oldest was 93.\nI received my patriarchal blessing as a new member of the Church, at age 19, two years after I was baptized. My patriarch was incredibly old. He joined the Church in 1916 and was a pioneer of the Church in Japan. It was my great honor to receive my patriarchal blessing from that remarkable disciple of the Lord. His Japanese was a bit difficult for me to understand, but it was powerful.\nThe patriarchs I have met tell me that many individuals receive their patriarchal blessings just before serving a mission. My dear young men, young women, parents, and bishops, patriarchal blessings are not only for preparation to serve a mission. Worthy baptized members may receive their patriarchal blessing when the time is right for them.\nDear adult members, some of you have not yet received your patriarchal blessings. Remember, there is no maximum age.\nMy mother-in-law was a very active Church member, serving as a Relief Society teacher until she passed away at age 91. I was sad to learn that she did not receive a patriarchal blessing. She experienced many difficulties in her life, and because she did not have a priesthood holder in the home, she did not receive many priesthood blessings. A patriarchal blessing may have given her comfort when she needed it most.\nAdults, if you have not yet received a patriarchal blessing, please do not worry! Everyone\u2019s spiritual timeline is different. If you are 35 or 85 and you have a desire, talk to your bishop about receiving your blessing.\nNew members of the Church, have you heard of patriarchal blessings? I didn\u2019t know about the opportunity to receive one when I joined the Church, but my beloved bishop told me about patriarchal blessings and encouraged me to prepare to receive mine after I was baptized. My dear new members, you can receive a patriarchal blessing as well. The Lord will help you prepare for this sacred opportunity.\nLet\u2019s consider two purposes for a patriarchal blessing:\n\n\nA patriarchal blessing contains personal counsel from the Lord to you.\n\n\nA patriarchal blessing declares your lineage in the house of Israel.\n\n\nYour patriarchal blessing is a message from your Heavenly Father and will likely include promises and inspired counsel to guide you throughout your life. A patriarchal blessing is not going to map out your life or answer all your questions. If it doesn\u2019t mention an important life event, do not take that to mean you won\u2019t have that opportunity. Likewise, there is no guarantee everything in your blessing will come to pass in this life. A patriarchal blessing is eternal, and if you live worthy, promises that are not fulfilled in this life will be granted in the next.\nAs you receive a declaration of lineage, you will come to know that you are of the house of Israel and the seed of Abraham. To understand the significance of this, focus on the promises the Lord made to the house of Israel through Abraham.\nThose promises include:\n\n\n\u201cHis posterity would be numerous (see [[Genesis 17|Genesis 17:5\u20136]]; [[Abraham 2|Abraham 2:9]]; [[Abraham 3|3:14]]).\n\n\n\u201cHis seed, or descendants, would receive the gospel and bear the priesthood (see [[Abraham 2|Abraham 2:9]]).\n\n\n\u201cThrough the ministry of his seed, \u2018all the families of the earth [would] be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal\u2019 ([[Abraham 2|Abraham 2:11]]).\u201d\n\n\nAs members of the Church, we are children of the covenant. We receive the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant as we obey the laws and ordinances of the gospel.\nPreparation for your patriarchal blessing will help you increase your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. And when you receive your patriarchal blessing and read and ponder it, you can focus on Them more often.\nPresident Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson explained, \u201cThe same Lord who provided a Liahona for Lehi provides for you and for me today a rare and valuable gift to give direction to our lives, to mark the hazards to our safety, and to chart the way, even safe passage\u2014not to a promised land, but to our heavenly home.\u201d\nMy dear bishops, parents, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, ward mission leaders, ministering brothers and sisters, please encourage those young men and young women, adult members, and new members who have not yet received their patriarchal blessing to seek the Lord\u2019s direction and help in preparing themselves to do so.\nI frequently and prayerfully read my patriarchal blessing; it always gives me encouragement. I recognize what the Lord expects of me, and it has helped me to repent and be humble. When I read and ponder it, I desire to live worthy of receiving its promised blessings.\nJust as scriptures we have read many times have new meaning to us later, our patriarchal blessing will have a different meaning to us at different times. Mine has a different meaning now than it did when I was 30 and when I was 50. It is not that the words change, but we see them in a different way.\nPresident Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks declared that a patriarchal blessing \u201cis given under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and should be read and interpreted under the influence of that same Spirit. The meaning and significance of a patriarchal blessing will be taught line upon line in the course of time by the power of the same Spirit that inspired [it].\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, I bear my witness that Heavenly Father and His Beloved and Only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, live. They love us. Patriarchal blessings are sacred gifts from Them. When you receive your blessing, you will realize and feel how They love you and how They focus on you individually.\nThe Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ. And I am grateful to be led by a living prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson.\nI am so grateful for our Savior, Jesus Christ. This Easter Sunday I will focus on Him and His Resurrection and worship Him and give thanks for His sacrifice. I know He suffered so deeply because He loves us so deeply. I know He was resurrected because of His love for us. He is real. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "In this beautiful Easter season, I echo the prayer of this powerful hymn, \u201cGuide us, O thou great Jehovah.\u201d\nA remarkable story in the Book of Mormon tells of a young man, from a prominent family, named Alma, whom the scriptures describe as an idolatrous unbeliever. He was articulate and convincing, using flattery to persuade others to follow him. Astonishingly, an angel appeared to Alma and his friends. Alma fell to the earth and was so weak that he was carried helplessly to his father\u2019s home. He remained in a seemingly comatose state for three days. Later, he explained that while he appeared unconscious to those around him, his mind was very active as his soul grieved, thinking about his life of disregarding the commandments of God. He described his mind as being \u201charrowed up by the memory of [his] many sins\u201d and \u201cracked with eternal torment.\u201d\nIn his deep despair, he remembered being taught in his youth about \u201cthe coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.\u201d Next he made this very compelling statement: \u201cAs my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me.\u201d As he appealed for the divine power of the Savior, something miraculous happened: \u201cWhen I thought this,\u201d he said, \u201cI could remember my pains no more.\u201d Suddenly he felt peace and light. \u201cNothing [was] so exquisite and sweet as was my joy,\u201d he declared.\nAlma \u201ccaught hold upon\u201d the truth of Jesus Christ. If we were using the words \u201ccaught hold upon\u201d in a physical sense, we might say, \u201cHe caught hold upon the guardrail just as he was falling,\u201d meaning he reached out suddenly and tightly seized something solidly cemented to a secure foundation.\nIn Alma\u2019s case, it was his mind that reached out and secured this powerful truth of Jesus Christ\u2019s atoning sacrifice. Acting in faith on that truth, and by the power and grace of God, he was rescued from despair and filled with hope.\nWhile our experiences may not be as dramatic as Alma\u2019s, they are nonetheless as eternally significant. Our minds have also \u201ccaught hold upon this thought\u201d of Jesus Christ and His merciful sacrifice, and our souls have felt the light and joy that follow.\n\n\nSecuring the Thought of Jesus Christ\n\nMy prayer at this Easter season is that we will more consciously shape, strengthen, and secure this preeminent thought of Jesus Christ in the chambers of our soul, allowing it to eagerly flow into our mind, guide us in what we think and do, and continually bring the sweet joy of the Savior\u2019s love.\nFilling our mind with the power of Jesus Christ does not mean that He is the only thought we have. But it does mean that all our thoughts are circumscribed in His love, His life and teachings, and His atoning sacrifice and glorious Resurrection. Jesus is never in a forgotten corner, because our thoughts of Him are always present and \u201call that is in [us adores] him!\u201d We pray and rehearse in our mind experiences that have brought us closer to Him. We welcome into our mind divine images, holy scriptures, and inspired hymns to gently cushion the countless daily thoughts rushing through our busy lives. Our love for Him does not shield us from the sadness and sorrow in this mortal life, but it allows us to walk through the challenges with a strength far beyond our own.\n\n\nJesus, the very thought of thee\nWith sweetness fills my breast;\nBut sweeter far thy face to see\nAnd in thy presence rest.\n\n\nRemember, you are a spirit child of Heavenly Father. As the Apostle Paul explains, we are \u201cthe offspring of God.\u201d You have lived with your own individual identity long before coming to earth. Our Father created a perfect plan for us to come to earth, learn, and return to Him. He sent His Beloved Son that through the power of His infinite Atonement and Resurrection, we live beyond the grave; and as we are willing to exercise faith in Him and repent of our sins, we are forgiven and receive the hope of eternal life.\n\n\n\nGiving Our Mind and Spirit Exceptional Attention\n\nIn this mortal life, our mind and spirit need exceptional attention. Our mind allows us to live, to choose, and to discern good and evil. Our spirit receives the confirming witness that God is our Father, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that Their teachings are our guide to happiness here and eternal life beyond the grave.\nThe mind of Alma caught hold upon this thought of Jesus Christ. It changed his life. General conference is a time to understand what the Lord would have us do and become. It is also a time to reflect on our progress. As my assignments have taken me throughout the world, I have observed an increasing spiritual strength in the righteous, devoted members of the Church.\nFive years ago, we were asked to place the Savior more prominently in all we do by using the true name of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are speaking His name more earnestly.\nFour years ago, by reducing the time of our sacrament meeting, we increased our focus on partaking of the Lord\u2019s sacrament. We are thinking more of Jesus Christ and are more serious in our promise to always remember Him.\nWith the isolation of the worldwide pandemic and the help of Come, Follow Me, the teachings of the Savior are becoming more prominent in our homes, helping our worship of the Savior during the week.\nBy following President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson\u2019s counsel to \u201chear Him,\u201d we are refining our ability to recognize the whisperings of the Holy Ghost and to see the hand of the Lord in our lives.\nWith the announcement and completion of dozens of temples, we are more frequently entering the house of the Lord and receiving His promised blessings. We are feeling more powerfully the transcendent beauty of our Savior and Redeemer.\nPresident Nelson said: \u201cThere is nothing easy or automatic about becoming [a] powerful [disciple]. Our focus must be riveted on the Savior and His gospel. It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him in *every* thought.\u201d\nBy focusing our attention on Jesus Christ, all else around us\u2014while still present\u2014is viewed through our love for Him. Less important distractions fade, and we remove those things that are not in keeping with His light and character. As you continue to attentively catch hold of this thought of Jesus Christ, trust in Him, and keep His commandments, I promise you not only heavenly guidance but heavenly power\u2014power that brings strength to your covenants, peace to your difficulties, and joy to your blessings.\n\n\n\nRemembering Jesus Christ\n\nA few weeks ago, Kathy and I visited the home of Matt and Sarah Johnson. On the wall was a picture of their precious family, a beautiful image of the Savior, and an illustration of the temple.\nTheir four daughters, Maddy, Ruby, Claire, and June, spoke happily about how much they loved their mother.\nFor over a year Sarah had regularly scheduled Saturday appointments for the family to attend the temple together so that the girls could participate in baptisms for family members who lived previously.\nIn November of last year, Sarah scheduled a family temple appointment for the last week in December on Thursday instead of Saturday. \u201cI hope you\u2019re OK with that,\u201d she said to Matt.\nSarah had been diagnosed with cancer, but the doctors anticipated she would live two or three more years. During a sacrament meeting, Sarah had shared her powerful testimony, saying that whatever the outcome for her, she loved the Savior with all her heart and that \u201cthe victory had already been won\u201d by Him. As December progressed, unexpectedly Sarah\u2019s health rapidly declined, and she was admitted to the hospital. In the early morning of Thursday, December&nbsp;29, she quietly completed her mortality. Matt had been by Sarah\u2019s side all through the night.\nWith his heart breaking, and completely exhausted physically and emotionally, he arrived home, sorrowing with his daughters. As Matt glanced at his phone, he noticed the reminder of the unusual Thursday temple appointment Sarah had scheduled for later that day. Matt said, \u201cWhen I first saw it, I thought, This just isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\nBut then Matt\u2019s mind caught hold upon this thought: \u201cThe Savior lives. There is no place we would rather be as a family than in His holy house.\u201d\n\nMatt, Maddy, Ruby, Claire, and June arrived at the temple for the appointment Sarah had scheduled for them. With tears streaming down his cheeks, Matt performed the baptisms with his daughters. They deeply felt their love and eternal bond with Sarah, and they felt the immense love and comforting peace of the Savior. Matt tenderly shared, \u201cWhile I feel deep sorrow and grief, I am shouting for joy, knowing my Father\u2019s wonderful plan of salvation.\u201d\nIn this Easter season, I witness the complete and absolute truth of the Savior\u2019s incomparable atoning sacrifice and of His glorious Resurrection. As your mind remains firmly and forever upon the thought of Jesus Christ, and as you continue to focus your life more fully on the Savior, I promise you that you will feel His hope, His peace, and His love. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; \u2026 a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, it is almost impossible to hear these words from the Prophet Joseph Smith and not break out into a great big smile!\nJoseph\u2019s jubilant expression truly captures the full and majestic joy found in God our Heavenly Father\u2019s great plan of happiness, for He has assured us, \u201cMen are, that they might have joy.\u201d\nWe all shouted for joy in our premortal life when we heard God\u2019s plan of happiness, and we continue to shout for joy here as we live according to His plan. But what exactly was the context for this happy declaration from the Prophet? What spurred these deep and heartfelt emotions?\nThe Prophet Joseph had been teaching about baptism for the dead. This was indeed a glorious revelation that was received with great joy. When Church members first learned that they could be baptized for their deceased loved ones, they rejoiced. Wilford Woodruff said, \u201cThe moment I heard of it, my soul leaped [for] joy!\u201d\nBaptism for our deceased loved ones wasn\u2019t the only truth the Lord would reveal and restore. There were a host of other gifts, or endowments, that God had been eager to bestow upon His sons and daughters.\nThese other gifts included priesthood authority, covenants and ordinances, marriages that could last forever, the sealing of children to their parents within the family of God, and ultimately the blessing of returning home to the presence of God, our Heavenly Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ. All these blessings were made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\nBecause God considered these to be among His highest and holiest blessings, He instructed that sacred buildings be erected where He could confer these precious gifts upon His children. These buildings would be His home on earth. These buildings would be temples where that which was sealed or bound on earth in His name, by His word, and with His authority would be bound in the heavens.\nAs members of the Church today, some of us may find it easy to take these glorious eternal truths for granted. They have become second nature to us. Sometimes it is helpful when we see them through the eyes of those who learn about them for the very first time. This became evident to me through a recent experience.\nLast year, just prior to the rededication of the Tokyo Japan Temple, many guests not of our faith toured that temple. One such tour included a thoughtful leader from another religion. We taught our guest about Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of happiness, Jesus Christ\u2019s redeeming role in that plan, and the doctrine that families can be united eternally through the sealing ordinance.\nAt the conclusion of the tour, I invited our friend to share his feelings. In reference to the uniting of families\u2014past, present, and future\u2014this good man asked in all sincerity, \u201cDo the members of your faith truly understand just how profound this doctrine is?\u201d He added, \u201cThis may well be one of the only teachings that can unite this world that is so divided.\u201d\nWhat a powerful observation. This man was not moved simply by the exquisite craftsmanship of the temple but rather by the stunning and profound doctrine that families are united and sealed to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ forever.\nWe should not be surprised, then, when even someone not of our faith recognizes the majesty of what happens in the temple. What could become common or routine for us is sometimes seen in its splendor and majesty by those who hear it or feel it for the very first time.\nAlthough temples had existed anciently, with the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the building of temples has been one of the highest priorities of all prophets since the Prophet Joseph Smith. And it is easy to understand why.\nWhen the Prophet Joseph was teaching about baptism for the dead, he revealed another great truth. He taught: \u201cLet me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, \u2026 they without us cannot be made perfect\u2014neither can we without our dead be made perfect.\u201d\nAs we can see, the need for temples and the work that is done for both the living and the dead become very clear.\nThe adversary is on the alert. His power is threatened by the ordinances and covenants performed in temples, and he does anything he can to try to stop the work. Why? Because he knows of the power that comes from this sacred work. As each new temple is dedicated, the saving power of Jesus Christ expands throughout the world to counteract the efforts of the adversary and to redeem us as we come unto Him. As temples and covenant keepers grow in number, the adversary grows weaker.\nIn the early days of the Church, some would worry when a new temple would be announced, for they would say, \u201cWe never began to build a temple without the bells of hell starting to ring.\u201d But Brigham Young courageously retorted, \u201cI want to hear them ring again.\u201d\nIn this mortal life, we will never escape the war, but we can have power over the enemy. That power and strength come from Jesus Christ as we make and keep temple covenants.\n\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught: \u201cThe time is coming when those who do not obey the Lord will be separated from those who do. Our safest insurance is to continue to be worthy of admission to His holy house.\u201d\nHere are some additional blessings God has promised us through His prophet:\nDo you need miracles? Our prophet has said: \u201cI promise you that the Lord will bring the miracles He knows you need as you make sacrifices to serve and worship in His temples.\u201d\nDo you need the healing and strengthening power of the Savior Jesus Christ? President Nelson reassures us that \u201ceverything taught in the temple \u2026 increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. \u2026 As we keep our covenants, He endows us with *His* healing, strengthening power. And oh, how we will need His power in the days ahead.\u201d\nOn the first Palm Sunday, as Jesus Christ triumphantly entered Jerusalem, a multitude of His disciples \u201crejoice[d] and praise[d] God with a loud voice \u2026 saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d\nHow fitting that on Palm Sunday of 1836, the Kirtland Temple was being dedicated. On that occasion the disciples of Jesus Christ were rejoicing as well. In that dedicatory prayer, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared these words of praise:\n\u201cO Lord God Almighty, hear us \u2026 and answer us from heaven, \u2026 where thou sittest enthroned, with glory, honor, power, majesty, [and] might.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026 Help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!\n\u201cAnd let these \u2026 thy saints shout aloud for joy.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, today on this Palm Sunday, let us as disciples of Jesus Christ also praise our holy God and rejoice in His goodness to us. \u201cWhat do we hear in the gospel which we have received?\u201d Truly \u201ca voice of gladness!\u201d\nI witness that you will feel joy more and more as you enter the holy temples of the Lord. I witness that you will experience the joy He in turn has for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

I pray that the Holy Ghost will communicate what the Lord wants you to hear as I speak to you now.\nDuring my surgical internship many years ago, I assisted a surgeon who was amputating a leg filled with highly infectious gangrene. The operation was difficult. Then, to add to the tension, one of the team performed a task poorly, and the surgeon erupted in anger. In the middle of his tantrum, he threw his scalpel loaded with germs. It landed in *my* forearm!\nEveryone in the operating room\u2014except the out-of-control surgeon\u2014was horrified by this dangerous breach of surgical practice. Gratefully, I did not become infected. But this experience left a lasting impression on me. In that very hour, I promised myself that *whatever* happened in *my* operating room, I would *never* lose control of my emotions. I also vowed that day never to throw anything in anger\u2014whether it be scalpels or words.\nEven now, decades later, I find myself wondering if the contaminated scalpel that landed in my arm was any more toxic than the venomous contention that infects our civic dialogue and too many personal relationships today. Civility and decency seem to have disappeared during this era of polarization and passionate disagreements.\nVulgarity, faultfinding, and evil speaking of others are all too common. Too many pundits, politicians, entertainers, and other influencers throw insults constantly. I am greatly concerned that so many people seem to believe that it is completely acceptable to condemn, malign, and vilify *anyone* who does not agree with them. Many seem eager to damage another\u2019s reputation with pathetic and pithy barbs!\nAnger never persuades. Hostility builds no one. Contention never leads to inspired solutions. Regrettably, we sometimes see contentious behavior even within our own ranks. We hear of those who belittle their spouses and children, of those who use angry outbursts to control others, and of those who punish family members with the \u201csilent treatment.\u201d We hear of youth and children who bully and of employees who defame their colleagues.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, this should not be. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are to be examples of how to interact with others\u2014*especially* when we have differences of opinion. One of the easiest ways to identify a *true follower* of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people.\nThe Savior made this clear in His sermons to followers in both hemispheres. \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers,\u201d He said. \u201cWhosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\u201d And then, of course, He gave the admonition that challenges each of us: \u201cLove your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\u201d\nBefore His death, the Savior commanded His Twelve Apostles to love one another as He had loved them. And then He added, \u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d\nThe Savior\u2019s message is clear: His *true* disciples build, lift, encourage, persuade, and inspire\u2014no matter how difficult the situation. True disciples of Jesus Christ are peacemakers.\nToday is Palm Sunday. We are preparing to commemorate the most important and transcendent event ever recorded on earth, which is the Atonement and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. One of the best ways we can honor the Savior is to become a peacemaker.\nThe Savior\u2019s Atonement made it possible for us to overcome *all* evil\u2014including contention. Make no mistake about it: contention *is* evil! Jesus Christ declared that those who have \u201cthe spirit of contention\u201d are not of Him but are \u201cof the devil, who is the father of contention, and [the devil] stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.\u201d Those who foster contention are taking a page out of Satan\u2019s playbook, whether they realize it or not. \u201cNo man can serve two masters.\u201d We cannot support Satan with our verbal assaults and then think that we can still serve God.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, how we treat each other really matters! How we speak to and about others at home, at church, at work, and online really matters. Today, I am asking us to interact with others in a higher, holier way. Please listen carefully. \u201cIf there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy\u201d that we can say about another person\u2014whether to his face or behind her back\u2014that should be *our *standard of communication.\nIf a couple in your ward gets divorced, or a young missionary returns home early, or a teenager doubts his testimony, they do not need your judgment. They need to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in your words and actions.\nIf a friend on social media has strong political or social views that violate everything you believe in, an angry, cutting retort by you will not help. Building bridges of understanding will require much more of you, but that is exactly what your friend needs.\nContention drives away the Spirit\u2014every time. Contention reinforces the false notion that confrontation is the way to resolve differences; but it never is. Contention is a choice. Peacemaking is a choice. You have your agency to choose contention or reconciliation. I urge you to *choose* to be a peacemaker, now and always.\nBrothers and sisters, we can literally change the world\u2014one person and one interaction at a time. How? By modeling how to manage honest differences of opinion with mutual respect and dignified dialogue.\nDifferences of opinion are part of life. I work every day with dedicated servants of the Lord who do not always see an issue the same way. They know I want to hear their ideas and honest feelings about everything we discuss\u2014*especially* sensitive issues.\n\nMy two noble counselors, President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks and President Henry&nbsp;B. Eyring, are exemplary in the way they express their feelings\u2014especially when they may differ. They do so with pure love for each other. Neither suggests that he knows best and therefore must rigorously defend his position. Neither evidences the need to compete with the other. Because each is filled with charity, \u201cthe pure love of Christ,\u201d our deliberations can be guided by the Spirit of the Lord. How I love and honor these two great men!\nCharity is the antidote to contention. Charity is the spiritual gift that helps us to cast off the natural man, who is selfish, defensive, prideful, and jealous. Charity is the principal characteristic of a true follower of Jesus Christ. Charity defines a peacemaker.\nWhen we humble ourselves before God and pray with *all* the energy of our hearts, God will grant us charity.\nThose blessed with this supernal gift are long-suffering and kind. They do not envy others and are not caught up in their own importance. They are not easily provoked and do not think evil of others.\nBrothers and sisters, the pure love of Christ is the answer to the contention that ails us today. Charity propels us \u201cto bear one another\u2019s burdens\u201d rather than heap burdens upon each other. The pure love of Christ allows us \u201cto stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things\u201d\u2014*especially* in tense situations. Charity allows us to demonstrate how men and women of Christ speak and act\u2014*especially* when under fire.\nNow, I am not talking about \u201cpeace at any price.\u201d I am talking about treating others in ways that are consistent with keeping the covenant you make when you partake of the sacrament. You covenant to *always* remember the Savior. In situations that are highly charged and filled with contention, I invite you to remember Jesus Christ. Pray to have the courage and wisdom to say or do what He would. As we follow the Prince of Peace, we will become His peacemakers.\nAt this point you may be thinking that this message would really help someone you know. Perhaps you are hoping that it will help him or her to be nicer to you. I hope it will! But I also hope that you will look deeply into *your* heart to see if there are shards of pride or jealousy that prevent *you* from becoming a peacemaker.\nIf you are serious about helping to gather Israel and about building relationships that will last throughout the eternities, *now* is the time to lay aside bitterness. *Now* is the time to cease insisting that it is your way or no way. *Now* is the time to stop doing things that make others walk on eggshells for fear of upsetting you. *Now* is the time to bury your weapons of war. If your verbal arsenal is filled with insults and accusations, *now* is the time to put them away. You will arise as a spiritually strong man or woman of Christ.\nThe temple can help us in our quest. There we are endowed with God\u2019s power, giving us the ability to overcome Satan, the instigator of *all* contention. Cast him out of your relationships! Note that we also rebuke the adversary every time we heal a misunderstanding or refuse to take offense. Instead, we can show the tender mercy that is characteristic of true disciples of Jesus Christ. Peacemakers thwart the adversary.\nLet us as a people become a true light on the hill\u2014a light that \u201ccannot be hid.\u201d Let us show that there is a peaceful, respectful way to resolve complex issues and an enlightened way to work out disagreements. As you demonstrate the charity that true followers of Jesus Christ manifest, the Lord will magnify your efforts beyond your loftiest imagination.\nThe gospel net is the largest net in the world. God has invited *all* to come unto Him, \u201cblack and white, bond and free, male and female.\u201d There is room for everyone. However, there is *no* room for prejudice, condemnation, or contention of any kind.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, the best is yet to come for those who spend their lives building up others. Today I invite you to examine your discipleship within the context of the way you treat others. I bless you to make any adjustments that may be needed so that your behavior is ennobling, respectful, and representative of a true follower of Jesus Christ.\nI bless you to replace belligerence with beseeching, animosity with understanding, and contention with peace.\nGod lives! Jesus is the Christ. He stands at the head of this Church. We are His servants. He will help us to become His peacemakers. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Most of these selections are in the sequence in which our Savior spoke them.\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d\n\u201cBlessed are \u2026 they [which] do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled *with the Holy Ghost*.\u201d\n\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\u201d\n\u201cYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:\n\u201cBut I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\u201d\n\u201cYe have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.\n\u201cBut I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;\n\u201cThat ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\u201d\n\u201cIf ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:\n\u201cBut if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\u201d\n\u201cIf ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\u201d\n\u201cWherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\u201d\n\u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\n\u201cYe shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\n\u201cEven so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.\u201d\n\u201cNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\u201d\n\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d\n\u201cIf any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.\n\u201cAnd now for a man to take up his cross, is to deny himself all ungodliness, and every worldly lust, and keep my commandments.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore, forsake the world, and save your souls; for what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d\n\u201cIf any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\n\u201cFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\u201d\n\u201cOther sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\u201d\n\u201cJesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\n\u201cAnd whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.\u201d\n\u201c[The great commandment in the law is this:] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\n\u201cThis is the first and great commandment.\n\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n\u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d\n\u201cHe that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\u201d\n\u201cPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\u201d\n\u201cThis is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.\u201d\n\u201cBehold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\u201d\n\u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:\n\u201cTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d\nAfter His ministry in the Holy Land, Jesus Christ appeared to the righteous on the American continent. These are some of the words He spoke there:\n\u201cBehold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.\u201d\n\u201cI am the light and the life of the world. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.\n\u201cAnd ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings.\n\u201cAnd ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cBehold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin.\u201d\n\u201cAnd again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore I would that ye should be *perfect* even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and *pray* always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in my name.\u201d\n\u201cBehold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you\u2014that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\n\u201cAnd my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me \u2026 to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.\u201d\n\u201cNow this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.\u201d\nWe believe in Christ. I conclude with what He said about how we should know and follow His teachings:\n\u201cBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d\nI affirm the truth of these teachings in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "As we remember this weekend the Savior\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem shortly before His atoning sacrifice, I recall His words of hope and comfort: \u201cI am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.\u201d\nI love Him. I believe Him. I testify that He is the Resurrection and the Life.\nThis testimony has comforted and strengthened me during the past four and a half years since my wife, Barbara, passed away. I miss her.\nOften, I have been reflecting on our eternal marriage and our life together.\nI previously have shared how I first met Barbara and how that experience taught me to use the skill of \u201cfollowing up\u201d that I had learned on my mission. I had to follow up quickly with her after we first met because she was beautiful, popular, and had a very busy social calendar. I was smitten early because she was approachable and friendly. I admired her goodness. I felt that she and I belonged together. It seemed that simple in my mind.\nBarbara and I dated, and our relationship began to grow, but she was uncertain that marriage to me was right for her.\nIt wasn\u2019t enough for me to know; Barbara needed to know for herself. I knew if we spent time fasting and praying about the matter, Barbara could receive a confirmation from heaven.\nWe spent a weekend without dating so we could fast and pray individually to know for ourselves. Fortunately for me, she received the same confirmation that I did. The rest, as they say, is history.\nWhen Barbara passed away, our children put on her headstone several lessons that Barbara wanted them to remember. One of those lessons is \u201cwhat matters most is what lasts longest.\u201d\nToday I will share from my heart a few feelings and thoughts on what matters most.\nFirst, a relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is most important. This relationship matters most now and in eternity.\nSecond, family relationships are among those things that matter most.\nThroughout my ministry, I have visited many individuals and families impacted by devastating natural disasters. Many were displaced, hungry, and frightened. They needed medical assistance, food, and shelter.\nThey also needed their families.\nI recognize some may not have the blessings of a close family, so I include extended family, friends, and even ward families as \u201cfamily.\u201d These relationships are essential for emotional and physical health.\nThese relationships can also offer love, joy, happiness, and a sense of belonging.\nNurturing these important relationships is a choice. A choice to be part of a family requires commitment, love, patience, communication, and forgiveness. There may be times when we disagree with another person, but we can do so without being disagreeable. In courtship and marriage, we don\u2019t fall in love or fall out of love as though we are objects being moved on a chessboard. We choose to love and sustain one another. We do the same in other family relationships and with friends who are like family to us.\nThe family proclamation states that \u201cthe divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.\u201d\nAnother thing that matters most is following the promptings of the Spirit in our most important relationships and in our efforts to love our neighbors as ourselves, including in our private and public ministries. I learned this lesson early in my life while serving as a bishop.\nLate one cold, snowy winter evening, I was leaving my bishop\u2019s office when I had a strong impression to visit an elderly widow in the ward. I glanced at my watch\u2014it was 10:00 p.m. I reasoned that it was too late to make such a visit. And besides, it was snowing. I decided to visit this dear sister first thing in the morning rather than disturbing her at such a late hour. I drove home and went to bed but tossed and turned throughout the night because the Spirit was stirring me.\nEarly the next morning, I drove straight to the widow\u2019s home. Her daughter answered the door and tearfully said, \u201cOh, Bishop, thank you for coming. Mother passed away two hours ago\u201d\u2014I was devastated. I will never forget the feelings of my heart. I wept. Who more than this dear widow deserved to have her bishop hold her hand, comfort her, and perhaps give her a final blessing? I missed that opportunity because I reasoned away this strong prompting from the Spirit.\nBrothers and sisters, young men and young women, and Primary children, I testify that following the promptings of the Spirit is one of the things that matter most in all our relationships.\nFinally, on this Palm Sunday weekend, I testify that being converted to the Lord, bearing testimony of Him, and serving Him are also among the things that matter most.\nFaith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of our testimonies. A testimony is a witness or confirmation of eternal truth impressed upon individual hearts and souls through the Holy Ghost. A testimony of Jesus Christ, born of and strengthened by the Spirit, changes lives\u2014it changes the way we think and how we live. A testimony turns us toward our Heavenly Father and His divine Son.\nAlma taught:\n\u201cBehold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true. And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?\n\u201cBehold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit.\u201d\nHaving a testimony alone is not enough. As our conversion to Jesus Christ grows, we naturally want to testify of Him\u2014His goodness, love, and kindness.\nOften in our testimony meetings on fast Sundays, we hear the phrases \u201cI am thankful\u201d and \u201cI love\u201d more than we hear the phrases \u201cI know\u201d and \u201cI believe.\u201d\nI invite you to bear your testimony of Jesus Christ more often. Bear testimony of what you *know* and *believe* and what you *feel*, not just of what you are thankful for. Testify of your own experiences of coming to know and love the Savior, of living His teachings, and of His redemptive and enabling power in your life. As you bear testimony of what you *know*, *believe*, and *feel*, the Holy Ghost will confirm the truth to those who earnestly listen to your testimony. They will do so because they have watched you become a peaceful follower of Jesus Christ. They will see what it means to be His disciple. They will also feel something they may not have felt before. A pure testimony comes from a changed heart and *can be carried by the power of the Holy Ghost* into the hearts of others who are open to receive it.\nThose who feel something as a result of your testimony may then ask the Lord in prayer to confirm the truth of your testimony. Then they can know for themselves.\nBrothers and sisters, I testify and witness to you that I know that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the world. He lives. He is the resurrected Son of God, and this is His Church, led by His prophet and apostles. I pray that someday when I pass to the next world, I may do so with my testimony burning brightly.\nIn my ministry, I have learned what matters most is our relationships with Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, our families, and our neighbors, and allowing the Spirit of the Lord to guide us in those relationships so we can testify of the things that matter most and last longest. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Today, as has been said, we join with Christians around the world to honor Jesus Christ on this Palm Sunday. Nearly 2,000 years ago, Palm Sunday marked the beginning of the last week of the mortal ministry of Jesus Christ. It was the most important week in human history.\nWhat began with the heralding of Jesus as the promised Messiah in His triumphant entry into Jerusalem closed with His Crucifixion and Resurrection. By divine design, His atoning sacrifice concluded His mortal ministry, making it possible for us to live with our Heavenly Father for eternity.\nScriptures tell us that the week began with throngs standing at the gates of the city to see \u201cJesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.\u201d They \u201ctook branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d\nThat biblical account of so long ago reminds me of being on a Church assignment in Takoradi, Ghana. Remarkably, I was there on Palm Sunday.\n\nI was to divide the Takoradi Ghana Stake to create the Mpintsin Ghana Stake. Today, there are over 100,000 members of the Church in Ghana. (We welcome the Ga Mantse, His Majesty King Nii Tackie Teiko Tsuru&nbsp;II of Accra, Ghana, who is with us today.) Meeting with these Saints, I felt their profound love and devotion to the Lord. I expressed my great love for them and that the President of the Church loved them. I referred to the Savior\u2019s words recorded by John: \u201cThat ye love one another, as I have loved you.\u201d They deemed it the \u201cI love you conference.\u201d\n\nAs I looked up and down the rows of those dear brothers and sisters and their families in the chapel, I could see in their faces the glow of testimony and faith in Jesus Christ. I felt their desire to be counted as part of His far-reaching Church. And when the choir sang, they sang like angels.\n\n\nLike on Palm Sunday of old, these were disciples of Jesus Christ gathered to pay tribute to Him as did those at the gates of Jerusalem who, with palms in their hands, exclaimed, \u201cHosanna&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d\n\nEven the parishioners in a church nearby were honoring Palm Sunday. As I was speaking from the pulpit, I noticed out the window they were joyfully walking down the street waving palms in their hands, much like those in this photo. It was a sight I will never forget\u2014all of us that day worshipping the King of kings.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has admonished us to make Palm Sunday \u201ctruly holy by remembering, not just the palms that were waved to honor the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, but by remembering the palms of His hands.\u201d Then President Nelson referred to Isaiah, who spoke of the Savior\u2019s promising, \u201cI will never forget you,\u201d with these words: \u201cBehold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.\u201d\nThe Lord knows firsthand that mortality is hard. His wounds remind us that He \u201cdescended below \u2026 all\u201d that He might succor us when we suffer and be our example to \u201chold on thy way,\u201d His way, that \u201cGod shall be with [us] forever and ever.\u201d\nPalm Sunday was not just an event, another page in history with a date, time, and place. Jesus Christ\u2019s triumphant entry into Jerusalem and the events of the week that followed exemplify doctrine we can apply in our lives today.\nLet us look at some of the eternal doctrine that weaves through His ministry concluding in Jerusalem.\nFirst, prophecy. For example, Old Testament prophet Zechariah prophesied of Jesus Christ\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, even describing He would ride on a donkey. Jesus foretold His Resurrection as He prepared to enter the city, saying:\n\u201cBehold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,\n\u201cAnd shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.\u201d\nSecond, the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Smith taught, \u201cNo man can know that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.\u201d The Savior promised His disciples at the Last Supper in the upper room, \u201cI will not leave you comfortless.\u201d They would not be alone to carry the truths of the gospel forward but would have the consummate gift of the Holy Ghost to guide them. \u201cPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,\u201d He promised; \u201cnot as the world giveth, give I unto you.\u201d With the gift of the Holy Ghost, we have that same assurance\u2014that we \u201cmay always have his Spirit to be with [us]\u201d and \u201cby the power of the Holy Ghost [we] may know the truth of all things.\u201d\nThird, discipleship. True discipleship is unfailing commitment, obedience to eternal laws, and love of God, first and foremost. Nothing wavering. The multitude who paid tribute with palms hailed Him as the Messiah. That was exactly who He was. They were drawn to Him, His miracles, and His teachings. But the adulation for many did not last. Some who earlier had shouted, \u201cHosanna,\u201d soon turned and cried, \u201cCrucify him.\u201d\nFourth, the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In His final days, following Palm Sunday, He carried out His remarkable Atonement, from the agony of Gethsemane to the mockery of His trial, His torture on the cross, and His burial in a borrowed tomb. But it did not stop there. With the majesty of His calling as the Redeemer of all of Heavenly Father\u2019s children, three days later He stepped forth from that tomb, resurrected, as He had prophesied.\nAre we continually grateful for the incomparable Atonement of Jesus Christ? Do we feel its purifying power, right now? That is why Jesus Christ, the Author and Finisher of our salvation, went to Jerusalem, to save us all. Do these words in Alma strike a chord: \u201cIf ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?\u201d I can truly say, the choir in Takoradi that Palm Sunday sang \u201cthe song of redeeming love.\u201d\nThat last fateful week of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ gave the parable of the ten virgins. He was teaching of His return to those prepared to receive Him, not with palms in their hands but with the light of the gospel within them. He used the image of lamps lit and burning, with extra oil to fuel the flame, as a description of a willingness to live His ways, embrace His truths, and share His light.\nYou know the story. The ten virgins represent members of the Church, and the bridegroom represents Jesus Christ.\nThe ten virgins took their lamps and \u201cwent forth to meet the bridegroom.\u201d Five were wise, prepared with oil in their lamps and some to spare, and five were foolish, lamps dark with no oil in reserve. When the call came, \u201cBehold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him,\u201d the five who were \u201cwise and [had] received the truth, and [had] taken the Holy Spirit for their guide\u201d were ready for \u201ctheir king and their lawgiver,\u201d that \u201chis glory [would] be upon them.\u201d The other five were frantically trying to find oil. But it was too late. The procession went forward without them. When they knocked and pleaded for entrance, the Lord responded, \u201cI know you not.\u201d\nHow would we feel if He said to us, \u201cI know you not!\u201d\nWe, like the ten virgins, have lamps; but do we have oil? I fear there are some who are just getting by on a thin skiff of oil, too busy with worldly pressures to properly prepare. Oil comes from believing and acting on prophecy and the words of living prophets, President Nelson in particular, his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles. Oil fills our souls when we hear and feel the Holy Ghost and act on that divine guidance. Oil pours into our hearts when our choices show we love the Lord and we love what He loves. Oil comes from repenting and seeking the healing of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\nIf some of you are looking to fill what some call \u201ca bucket list,\u201d this is it: fill your bucket with oil in the form of the living water of Jesus Christ, which is a representation of His life and teachings. In contrast, checking off a far-off place or a spectacular event will never leave your soul feeling whole or satisfied; living the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ will. I mentioned examples earlier: embrace prophecy and prophetic teachings, act on promptings of the Holy Ghost, become a true disciple, and seek the healing power of our Lord\u2019s Atonement. That bucket list will take you somewhere you want to go\u2014back to your Father in Heaven.\nThat Palm Sunday in Takoradi was a very special experience for me because I shared it with a faithful congregation of brothers and sisters. So it has been on continents and islands all around the world. My heart and soul, like yours, longs to shout, \u201cHosanna to the Most High God.\u201d\nThough we do not stand at the gates of Jerusalem today with palms in our hands, the time will come when, as prophesied in Revelation, \u201ca great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, [will stand] before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.\u201d\nI leave with you my blessing as an Apostle of Jesus Christ that you will diligently strive to live righteously and be among those who, with palms in their hands, will herald the Son of God, the great Redeemer of us all. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

When the Father said, \u201cWhom shall I send?\u201d Jesus Christ stepped forward: \u201cHere am I, send me\u201d ([[Abraham 3|Abraham 3:27]]). President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught: \u201c[Jesus Christ\u2019s] mission was the Atonement. That mission was uniquely His. Born of a mortal mother and an immortal Father, He was the only one who could voluntarily lay down His life and take it up again (see [[John 10|John 10:14\u201318]]). The glorious consequences of His Atonement were infinite and eternal. He took the sting out of death and made temporary the grief of the grave (see [[1 Corinthians 15|1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:54\u201355]]). His responsibility for the Atonement was known even before the Creation and the Fall. Not only was it to provide for the resurrection and immortality of all humankind, but it was also to enable us to be forgiven of our sins\u2014upon conditions established by Him. Thus His Atonement opened the way by which we could be united with Him and with our families eternally\u201d (\u201c[The Mission and Ministry of Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2013/04/the-mission-and-ministry-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng),\u201d Ensign, Apr. 2013, 34; Liahona, Apr. 2013, 20)."

        "full_markdown": "As a young boy, I learned to love the dramatic changes in the seasons of the year in southwest Montana, where I grew up. My favorite season was fall\u2014the time of the harvest. Our family hoped and prayed that our months of hard work would be rewarded with a bountiful harvest. My parents worried over the weather, the health of animals and crops, and many other things over which they had little control.\nAs I grew, I became even more aware of the urgency involved. Our livelihood depended upon the harvest. My father taught me about the equipment we used to harvest grain. I watched as he would move the machinery into the field, cut a small swath of grain, and then check behind the combine to make sure that as much grain as possible landed in the holding tank and was not thrown out with the chaff. He repeated this exercise several times, adjusting the machine each time. I ran alongside and pawed through the chaff with him and pretended that I knew what I was doing.\nAfter he was satisfied with the adjustments to the machine, I found some kernels of grain in the chaff on the ground and presented them to him with a critical look. I will not forget what my father said to me: \u201cIt is good enough and the best that this machine can do.\u201d Not really satisfied with his explanation, I pondered the imperfections of this harvest.\nA short time later, when the weather turned cold in the evenings, I watched thousands of migrating swans, geese, and ducks descend onto the fields to nourish themselves on their long journey south. They ate the leftover grain from our imperfect harvest. God had perfected it. And not a kernel was lost.\nIt is often a temptation in our world and even within the culture of the Church to obsess about perfection. Social media, unrealistic expectations, and often our own self-criticism create feelings of inadequacy\u2014that we are not good enough and never will be. Some even misunderstand the invitation of the Savior to \u201cbe ye therefore perfect.\u201d\nRemember that perfectionism is not the same as being perfected in Christ. Perfectionism requires an impossible, self-inflicted standard that compares us to others. This causes guilt and anxiety and can make us want to withdraw and isolate ourselves.\nBecoming perfected in Christ is another matter. It is the process\u2014lovingly guided by the Holy Ghost\u2014of becoming more like the Savior. The standards are set by a kind and all-knowing Heavenly Father and clearly defined in the covenants we are invited to embrace. It relieves us of the burdens of guilt and inadequacy, always emphasizing who we are in the sight of God. While this process lifts us and pushes us to become better, we are measured by our personal devotion to God that we manifest in our efforts to follow Him in faith. As we accept the Savior\u2019s invitation to come unto Him, we soon realize that our best is good enough and that the grace of a loving Savior will make up the difference in ways we cannot imagine.\nWe can see this principle in effect when the Savior fed the five thousand.\n\u201cWhen Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cPhilip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.\n\u201cOne of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter\u2019s brother, saith unto him,\n\u201cThere is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?\u201d\nDo you ever wonder how the Savior must have felt about this young boy, who with the faith of a child offered what he must have known to be woefully inadequate in the face of the task at hand?\n\u201cAnd Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.\n\u201cWhen they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\u201d\nThe Savior perfected the humble offering.\nShortly after this experience, Jesus sent His disciples ahead on a boat. They soon found themselves on a stormy sea in the middle of the night. They became frightened when they saw a ghostly figure walking toward them on the water.\n\u201cBut straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.\n\u201cAnd Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.\n\u201cAnd he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.\n\u201cBut when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.\n\u201cAnd immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, that may not have been the end of the conversation. I believe that as Peter and the Savior walked back to the ship arm in arm, Peter soaking wet and perhaps feeling very foolish, the Savior may have said something like this: \u201cOh, Peter, fear not and worry not. If you could see yourself as I see you, your doubt would fade and your faith increase. I love you, dear Peter; you got out of the boat. Your offering is acceptable, and even though you faltered, I will always be there to lift you from the depths, and your offering will be made perfect.\u201d\nElder Dieter&nbsp;F. Uchtdorf taught:\n\u201cI believe the Savior Jesus Christ would want you to see, feel, and know that He is your strength. That with His help, there are no limits to what you can accomplish. That your potential is limitless. He would want you to see yourself the way He sees you. And that is very different from the way the world sees you.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cHe gives power to the weary; and to those who feel powerless, He increases strength.\u201d\nWe must remember that whatever our best-but-imperfect offering is, the Savior can make it perfect. No matter how insignificant our efforts may seem, we must never underestimate the Savior\u2019s power. A simple word of kindness, a brief but sincere ministering visit, or a Primary lesson lovingly taught can, with the Savior\u2019s help, provide comfort, soften hearts, and change eternal lives. Our clumsy efforts can lead to miracles, and in the process, we can participate in a perfect harvest.\nOften we are placed in situations that will cause us to stretch. We may not feel up to the task. We may look at those we serve with and feel that we will never measure up. Brothers and sisters, if you feel this way, look at the extraordinary men and women seated behind me with whom I serve.\nI feel your pain.\nI have learned, however, that just as perfectionism is not the same as being perfected in Christ, self-comparison is not the same as emulation. When we compare ourselves to others, there can be only two results. Either we will see ourselves as better than others and become judgmental and critical of them, or we will see ourselves as less than others and become anxious, self-critical, and discouraged. Comparing ourselves to others is rarely productive, not uplifting, and sometimes downright depressing. In fact, these comparisons can be spiritually destructive, preventing us from receiving the spiritual help we need. On the other hand, emulating those we respect who demonstrate Christlike attributes can be instructive and uplifting and can help us become better disciples of Jesus Christ.\nThe Savior gave us a model to follow as He emulated the Father. He instructed His disciple Philip: \u201cHave I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?\u201d\nAnd then He taught, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also.\u201d\nRegardless of how insignificant our efforts may seem, if we are sincere, the Savior will use us to accomplish His work. If we simply do the best we can and trust Him to make up the difference, we can become part of the miracles that surround us.\nElder Dale&nbsp;G. Renlund said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect, but we need you, because everybody who\u2019s willing can do something.\u201d\nAnd President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson teaches us, \u201cThe Lord loves effort.\u201d\nThe Savior stands ready to accept our humble offerings and perfect them through His grace. With Christ, there is no imperfect harvest. We must have the courage to believe that His grace is for us\u2014that He will help us, rescue us from the depths when we falter, and perfect our less-than-perfect efforts.\nIn the parable of the sower, the Savior describes the seeds that are planted in good ground. Some produce a hundredfold, some sixty, and others thirty. All are part of His perfect harvest.\nThe prophet Moroni invited all, \u201cYea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, \u2026 and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, I testify of Christ, who has the power to perfect even our most humble offering. Let us do our best, bring what we can, and, with faith, lay our imperfect offering at His feet. In the name of Him who is Master of the perfect harvest, even Jesus Christ, amen.",

When we compare ourselves to others, there can be only two results. Either we will see ourselves as better than others and become judgmental and critical of them, or we will see ourselves as less than others and become anxious, self-critical, and discouraged. Comparing ourselves to others is rarely productive, not uplifting, and sometimes downright depressing. In fact, these comparisons can be spiritually destructive, preventing us from receiving the spiritual help we need. On the other hand, emulating those we respect who demonstrate Christlike attributes can be instructive and uplifting and can help us become better disciples of Jesus Christ."

        "full_markdown": "As we have been reminded this morning, today is Palm Sunday, marking the Savior\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem and the beginning of that holy week preceding His great Atonement, which would include His suffering, Crucifixion, and Resurrection.\nNot long before His prophesied entry into the city, Jesus Christ was fully engaged in His ministry when He received word from His dear friends Mary and Martha that their brother Lazarus was sick.\nAlthough Lazarus\u2019s illness was serious, the Lord \u201cabode two days still in the same place where he was. Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.\u201d Before beginning the journey to His friends\u2019 home in Bethany, \u201csaid Jesus unto [His disciples] plainly, Lazarus is dead.\u201d\nWhen Jesus came into Bethany and met first Martha and then Mary, perhaps out of frustration for His late arrival, they each greeted Him saying, \u201cLord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.\u201d Martha further exclaimed, \u201cBy this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.\u201d\nThese four days were significant to Mary and Martha. According to some rabbinic schools of thought, it was believed that the spirit of someone who died would remain with the body for three days, offering hope that life was still possible. However, by the fourth day that hope was lost, perhaps because the body would begin to decay and \u201cstinketh.\u201d\nMary and Martha were in a state of despair. \u201cWhen Jesus therefore saw [Mary] weeping, \u2026 he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,\n\u201cAnd said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.\u201d\nIt is at this moment that we see one of the great miracles during the Savior\u2019s mortal ministry. First the Lord said, \u201cTake ye away the stone.\u201d Then, after thanking His Father, \u201che cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.\n\u201cAnd he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.\u201d\nLike Mary and Martha, we have the opportunity to experience all of mortality, even sorrow and weakness. Each of us will experience the heartache that accompanies the loss of someone we love. Our mortal journey might include personal illness or the debilitating illness of a loved one; depression, anxiety, or other mental health challenges; financial hardship; betrayal; sin. And sometimes these are accompanied by feelings of hopelessness. I am no different. Like you, I have experienced a myriad of challenges that are expected in this life. I am drawn to this account about the Savior and what it teaches me about our relationship with Him.\nDuring our greatest worries, we, like Mary and Martha, seek the Savior or ask the Father for His divine intervention. The story of Lazarus teaches us principles that can be applied to our own lives as we face our individual challenges.\nWhen the Savior arrived in Bethany, all had lost hope that Lazarus could be saved\u2014it had been four days, and he was gone. Sometimes during our own challenges, we might feel like Christ is too late, and our hope and faith might even feel challenged. My witness and testimony are that as we move forward with faith in Jesus Christ, the fourth day will always come. He will always come to our aid or to raise our hopes back to life. He has promised:\n\u201cLet not your heart be troubled.\u201d\n\u201cI will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\u201d\nSometimes it may seem like He doesn\u2019t come to us until the figurative fourth day, after all hope seems lost. But why so late? President Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson taught, \u201cOur Heavenly Father, who gives us so much to delight in, also knows that we learn and grow and become stronger as we face and survive the trials through which we must pass.\u201d\nEven the Prophet Joseph Smith faced an enormous fourth-day experience. Remember his pleading? \u201cO God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?\u201d As we trust in Him, we can expect a like answer: \u201cMy son [or daughter], peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment.\u201d\nAnother message we can learn from the story of Lazarus is what our own role might be in the divine intervention we seek. When Jesus approached the tomb, He *first* said to those who were there, \u201cTake ye away the stone.\u201d With the power that the Savior had, could not *He* have miraculously moved the stone without effort? This would have been impressive to see and an unforgettable experience, yet He said to the others, \u201cTake ye away the stone.\u201d\n*Second*, the Lord \u201ccried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it have been more impressive if the Lord had Himself miraculously placed Lazarus at the opening so he would be immediately visible to the crowd when the stone was removed?\n*Third*, when Lazarus did come forth, he was \u201cbound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.\u201d I\u2019m sure the Lord was capable of having Lazarus standing at the opening, already clean and approachable, with his graveclothes nicely folded.\nWhat is the point of highlighting these aspects? Each of these three things had something in common\u2014none required the use of Christ\u2019s divine power. That which His disciples could do, He instructed *them* to do. The disciples were certainly capable of moving the stone themselves; Lazarus, after being raised, had the capacity to stand and present himself at the opening of the cave; and those who loved Lazarus could absolutely help him remove the graveclothes.\nHowever, it was only the Christ who had the power and authority to raise Lazarus from the dead. My impression is that the Savior expects us to do all we can do, and He will do what *only He* can do.\nWe know that \u201cfaith [in the Lord Jesus Christ] is a principle of action\u201d and \u201cmiracles do not produce faith, but strong faith is developed by obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ. In other words, faith comes by righteousness.\u201d As we strive to act righteously by making and keeping sacred covenants and applying the doctrine of Christ in our lives, our faith will not only be sufficient to carry us to the fourth day, but with the Lord\u2019s help we will also be capable of moving stones that are in our path, arising from despair, and loosening ourselves of all that binds us. While the Lord expects us to \u201cdo all things that lie in our power,\u201d remember that He will provide needed help in all these things as we trust in Him.\nHow can we move stones and build upon His rock? We can abide by the **counsel** of prophets.\nFor example, last October, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson pleaded with us to take charge of our own testimonies of the Savior and His gospel, to work for them and nurture them, to feed them truth, and to avoid polluting them with false philosophies of unbelievers. He promised each of us, \u201cAs you make the continual strengthening of your testimony of Jesus Christ your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life.\u201d\n*We can do this!*\nHow can we figuratively arise and come forth? We can joyfully repent and choose to obey **commandments**. The Lord said, \u201cHe that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\u201d We can strive to repent daily and joyfully move forward with a willing heart full of love for the Lord.\n*We can do this!*\nHow can we, with the Lord\u2019s help, loose ourselves of all that binds us? We can intentionally bind ourselves first and foremost to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, through **covenants**. Elder D.&nbsp;Todd Christofferson taught: \u201cWhat is the source of [our] moral and spiritual power, and how do we obtain it? The source is God. Our access to that power is through our covenants with Him. \u2026 In these divine agreements, God binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments.\u201d We can make and keep sacred covenants.\n*We can do this!*\n\u201cTake ye away the stone.\u201d \u201cCome forth.\u201d \u201cLoose him, and let him go.\u201d\nCounsels, commandments, and covenants. *We can do this!*\nElder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland promised, \u201cSome blessings come soon, some come late, and some don\u2019t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, *they come*.\u201d\nAnd finally, \u201cWherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you.\u201d\nThis is my witness and testimony, in the sacred name of Him who will always come, even Jesus Christ, amen.",

But as I went to speak, I had one of those moments where many thoughts flood your mind. This was the first time I would explain the \u201cwhy\u201d of Christianity to someone very unfamiliar with it and highly intelligent. I couldn\u2019t simply say, \u201cI follow Jesus Christ because He willingly suffered and died for my sins.\u201d She might wonder, \u201cDid Jesus have to die? Couldn\u2019t God simply forgive and cleanse us of our sins if we asked Him to?\u201d\nHow would you have responded in a few minutes? How would you explain this to a friend? Children and youth: would you please ask your parents or a leader later on, \u201cWhy did Jesus have to die?\u201d And, brothers and sisters, I have a confession to make: despite all I thought I knew about Church doctrine, history, policy, and so on, the answer to this central question to our faith did not come so easily. That day I decided to focus more on what matters most to eternal life.\nWell, I informed my new friend that we have a spirit in addition to a body and that God is the Father of our spirits. I told her we lived with our Heavenly Father before our births into this mortal world. Because He loves her and all His children, He made a plan for us to receive a body in the image of His glorified body, be part of a family, and return to His loving presence to enjoy eternal life with our families like He does with His. But, I said, we would face two main obstacles in this necessarily fallen world: (1)&nbsp;physical death\u2014the separation of our bodies from our spirits. Of course, she knew we would all die. And (2)&nbsp;spiritual death\u2014our separation from God because our sins, mistakes, and flaws as mortals distance us from His holy presence. She related to this too.\nI informed her that this was an effect of the law of justice. This *eternal law* demands that an *eternal penalty* be paid for every one of our sins, or violations of God\u2019s laws or truth, or we could *never* return to live in His holy presence. It would be unjust, and God \u201ccannot deny justice.\u201d She understood this but easily grasped that God is also merciful, loving, and eager to bring to pass our eternal life. I informed my friend that we would also have a cunning, powerful adversary\u2014the source of evil and lies\u2014opposing us. Therefore, someone with *infinite* godly power to overcome all such opposition and obstacles would need to save us.\nI then shared with her the good news\u2014the \u201cgood tidings of great joy \u2026 to all people\u201d\u2014that \u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d I testified to my friend, and I witness to you, that Jesus Christ is that Savior, that He *had* to suffer, die, and rise again\u2014His *infinite* Atonement\u2014to redeem all humanity from physical death and to give eternal life with God and our families to *all* who would follow Him. The Book of Mormon declares, \u201cThus God \u2026 gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;; being filled with [mercy and] compassion&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.\u201d\nThe steps God revealed we must take to follow Jesus and receive eternal life are called the doctrine of Christ. They include \u201cfaith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism [into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints], receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.\u201d I shared these steps with my friend, but here are some ways in which prophets and apostles have recently taught how the doctrine of Christ can bless all God\u2019s children.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson instructed: \u201cThe pure doctrine of Christ is powerful. It changes the life of *everyone* who understands it and seeks to implement it in his or her life.\u201d\nElder Dieter&nbsp;F. Uchtdorf taught, \u201c[The] *For the Strength of Youth* [guide] is bold in declaring the doctrine of \u2026 Christ [and] inviting you [*youth*] to make choices based on [it].\u201d\nElder Dale&nbsp;G. Renlund taught, \u201cWe invite *missionaries* to do what they ask those they teach to do: \u2026 apply the doctrine of Christ in their lives [and] get on and stay on the covenant path.\u201d\nThe doctrine of Christ empowers those who are *struggling or feel they don\u2019t belong in the Church* because it helps them, as Elder D.&nbsp;Todd Christofferson stated, \u201caffirm: Jesus Christ died for me \u2026 [and] loves me.\u201d\n*Parents*, if your child struggles with a gospel principle or prophetic teaching, *please* resist any type of evil speaking or activism toward the Church or its leaders. These lesser, secular approaches are beneath you and can be lethal to the long-term faithfulness of your child. It speaks so well of you that you would protect or advocate for your precious child or show signs of solidarity with him or her. But my wife, Jayne, and I know from personal experience that teaching your beloved child why we all desperately need Jesus Christ and how to apply His joyful doctrine is what will *strengthen and heal him or her*. Let us turn them to Jesus, who is their true advocate *with the Father*. The Apostle John taught, \u201cWhosoever \u2026 abideth in the doctrine of Christ \u2026 hath both the Father and the Son.\u201d He then warns us to beware \u201cif there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine.\u201d\nJayne and I recently visited the wilderness where Moses held up a serpent of brass before the wandering children of Israel. The Lord had promised to heal all who were bitten by poisonous snakes if they would simply look upon it. In holding up the doctrine of Christ before us, the Lord\u2019s prophet is doing the same, \u201cthat he should heal the nations.\u201d Whatever the bites or poison or struggles we experience in this mortal wilderness, let us not be as those who, anciently and presently, could have been healed but, sadly, \u201cwould not look \u2026 because they did not believe that it would heal them.\u201d The Book of Mormon affirms: \u201cBehold, \u2026 this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ.\u201d\nThat evening in New Jersey, sharing why we need Jesus Christ and His doctrine gave me a new sister and her a new brother. We felt the peaceful, confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. Naturally, I invited her to share her contact information and continue the conversation with our missionaries. She was happy to do so.\n\u201cWherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth,\u201d the Book of Mormon declares\u2014to love, share, and invite as we gather Israel in all our communities *and families*\u2014\u201cthat they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace [and doctrine] of the Holy Messiah.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Already-deceased family members in the spirit world who were not able to embrace the doctrine of Christ in this life can do so in the spirit world as ordinances like baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and others that help us endure to the end are lovingly performed vicariously by living relatives in temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Additionally, the promise of eternal life is not just to those who are married in this life. President M.&nbsp;Russell Ballard taught, \u201cScriptures and latter-day prophets confirm that *everyone* who is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation\u201d (\u201c[Hope in Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/28ballard?lang=eng&amp;id=p23#p23),\u201d Liahona, May 2021,&nbsp;55; emphasis added). Citing President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson and President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks, President Ballard continued, \u201cThe precise time and manner in which the blessings of exaltation are bestowed have not all been revealed, but they are nonetheless *assured*\u201d (\u201c[Hope in Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/28ballard?lang=eng&amp;id=p24#p24),\u201d&nbsp;55; emphasis added). President Nelson taught: \u201cIn the Lord\u2019s own way and time, no [blessing] will be withheld from His faithful Saints.

And President Oaks explained, \u201cMany of the most important deprivations of mortality will be set right in the Millennium, which is the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the great plan of happiness for all of our Father\u2019s worthy children\u201d (\u201c[The Great Plan of Happiness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1993/10/the-great-plan-of-happiness?lang=eng&amp;id=p40#p40),\u201d Ensign, Nov. 1993,&nbsp;75).

        "full_markdown": "The ancient prophet Enoch, described in the Old Testament, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price, was instrumental in establishing the city of Zion.\nThe scriptural account of Enoch\u2019s call to serve indicates that \u201che heard a voice from heaven, saying: Enoch, my son, prophesy unto this people, and say unto them\u2014Repent, \u2026 for their hearts have waxed hard, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes cannot see afar off.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth \u2026 and spake before the Lord, saying: Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?\u201d\nPlease notice that at the time of Enoch\u2019s call to serve, he became acutely aware of his personal inadequacies and limitations. And I suspect all of us at one time or another in our Church service have felt much like Enoch. But I believe the Lord\u2019s response to Enoch\u2019s pleading question is instructive and applies to each of us today.\n\u201cAnd the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cBehold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt *abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me.*\u201d\nEnoch ultimately became a mighty prophet and a tool in God\u2019s hands to accomplish a great work, but he did not start his ministry that way! Rather, his capacity over time was magnified as he learned to abide in and walk with the Son of God.\nI earnestly pray for the help of the Holy Ghost as we consider together the counsel given to Enoch by the Lord and what it can mean for you and me today.\n\n\nThou Shalt Abide in Me\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ extends to each of us the invitation to abide in Him. But how do we actually learn and come to abide in Him?\nThe word *abide* denotes remaining fixed or stable and enduring without yielding. Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland explained that \u201cabiding\u201d as an action means \u201c\u2018[to] stay\u2014but [to] stay *forever*.\u2019 That is the call of the gospel message to \u2026 everyone \u2026 in the world. Come, but come to remain. Come with conviction and endurance. Come permanently, for your sake and the sake of all the generations who must follow you.\u201d Thus, we abide in Christ as we are firm and steadfast in our devotion to the Redeemer and His holy purposes, in times both good and bad.\nWe begin to abide in the Lord by exercising our moral agency to take upon ourselves His yoke through the covenants and ordinances of the restored gospel. The covenant connection we have with our Heavenly Father and His resurrected and living Son is the supernal source of perspective, hope, power, peace, and enduring joy; it also is the rock-solid foundation upon which we should build our lives.\nWe abide in Him by striving continually to strengthen our individual covenant bond with the Father and the Son. For example, praying sincerely to the Eternal Father in the name of His Beloved Son deepens and fortifies our covenant connection with Them.\nWe abide in Him by truly feasting upon the words of Christ. The Savior\u2019s doctrine draws us, as children of the covenant, closer to Him and will tell us all things what we should do.\nWe abide in Him by preparing earnestly to participate in the ordinance of the sacrament, reviewing and reflecting on our covenant promises, and repenting sincerely. Worthily partaking of the sacrament is a witness to God that we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and strive to \u201calways remember him\u201d after the brief period of time required to participate in that sacred ordinance.\nAnd we abide in Him by serving God as we serve His children and minister to our brothers and sisters.\nThe Savior said, \u201cIf ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments, and abide in his love.\u201d\nI briefly have described several of the many ways we can abide in the Savior. And I now invite each of us as His disciples to ask, seek, knock, and learn for ourselves by the power of the Holy Ghost other meaningful ways we can make Christ the center of our lives in all that we do.\n\n\n\nAnd I in You\n\nThe Savior\u2019s promise to His followers is twofold: if we abide in Him, He will abide in us. But is it indeed possible for Christ to abide in you and me\u2014individually and personally? The answer to this question is a resounding yes!\nIn the Book of Mormon, we learn about Alma\u2019s teaching and testifying to the poor whose afflictions had compelled them to be humble. In his instruction, he compared the word to a seed that must be planted and nourished, and he described \u201cthe word\u201d as the life, mission, and atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.\nAlma said, \u201cBegin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.\u201d\nGiven this description of \u201cthe word\u201d by Alma, please consider the inspiring connection he then identifies.\n\u201cAnd now \u2026 I desire that ye shall *plant this word in your hearts*, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your faith. And behold, *it will become a tree*, springing up *in you* unto everlasting life. And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye will.\u201d\nThe seed we should strive to plant in our hearts is the word\u2014even the life, mission, and doctrine of Jesus Christ. And as the word is nourished by faith, it can become a tree springing up *in us* unto everlasting life.\nWhat was the symbolism of the tree in Lehi\u2019s vision? The tree can be considered as a representation of Jesus Christ.\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, is the Word in us? Are the truths of the Savior\u2019s gospel written in the fleshy tables of our hearts? Are we coming unto and gradually becoming more like Him? Is the tree of Christ growing in us? Are we striving to become \u201cnew [creatures]\u201d in Him?\nPerhaps this miraculous potential inspired Alma to ask: \u201cHave ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?\u201d\nWe should always remember the Lord\u2019s instruction to Enoch: \u201cThou shalt abide in me, *and I in you*.\u201d And I testify the Savior\u2019s promise to abide in us is true and available to every covenant-keeping member of His restored Church.\n\n\n\nTherefore Walk with Me\n\nThe Apostle Paul admonished believers who had received the Lord: \u201cSo walk ye in him.\u201d\nWalking in and with the Savior highlights two vital aspects of discipleship: (1)&nbsp;obeying God\u2019s commandments, and (2)&nbsp;remembering and honoring the sacred covenants that connect us to the Father and the Son.\nJohn declared:\n\u201cAnd hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.\n\u201cHe that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\n\u201cBut whoso keepeth his word, *in him* verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are *in him*.\n\u201cHe that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so *to walk, even as he walked*.\u201d\nJesus beckons to each of us, \u201cCome, follow me\u201d and \u201cwalk with me.\u201d\nI testify that as we press forward in faith and walk in the meekness of the Lord\u2019s Spirit, we are blessed with power, guidance, protection, and peace.\n\n\n\nTestimony and Promise\n\nAlma describes a loving entreaty from the Lord to all living souls:\n\u201cBehold, he sendeth an invitation unto *all men*, for the arms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.\n\u201c\u2026 Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life freely.\u201d\nI emphasize the absolute comprehensiveness of the Savior\u2019s plea. He yearns to bless with His grace and mercy every single person who now lives, who has ever lived, and who will yet live upon the earth.\nSome Church members accept as true the doctrine, principles, and testimonies proclaimed repeatedly from this pulpit in the Conference Center and in local congregations around the world\u2014and yet may struggle to believe these eternal truths apply specifically in their lives and to their circumstances. They believe sincerely and serve dutifully, but their covenant connection with the Father and His redeeming Son has not yet become a living and transforming reality in their lives.\nI promise that by the power of the Holy Ghost, you can know and feel the gospel truths I have attempted to describe are for you\u2014for you individually and personally.\nI joyfully witness that Jesus Christ is our loving and living Savior and Redeemer. If we abide in Him, He will abide in us. And as we walk in and with Him, we will be blessed to bring forth much fruit. I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.",

He also compared the word of God to a seed.\n\u201c\u2018Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves\u2014It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that *the word* is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me\u2019 [[[Alma 32|Alma 32:28]]; emphasis added].\n\u201cInterestingly, a good seed becomes a tree as it is planted in the heart and begins to swell, sprout, and grow.\n\u201c\u2018And behold, as *the tree* beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and *bring forth fruit* unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.\n\u201c\u2018But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.\n\u201c\u2018Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.\n\u201c\u2018And thus, if ye will not *nourish the word*, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.\n\u201c\u2018But if ye will *nourish the word*, yea, *nourish the tree* as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to *the fruit thereof*, it shall take root; and behold it shall be *a tree springing up unto everlasting life*\u2019 [[[Alma 32|Alma 32:37\u201341]]; emphasis added].\n\u201c\u2026 The central feature in Lehi\u2019s dream is the tree of life\u2014a representation of \u2018the love of God\u2019 [[[1 Nephi 11|1&nbsp;Nephi 11:21\u201322]]].\n\u201c\u2018For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\u2019 [[[John 3|John 3:16]]].\n\u201cThe birth, life, and atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ are the greatest manifestations of God\u2019s love for His children. As Nephi testified, this love was \u2018most desirable above all things\u2019 and \u2018most joyous to the soul\u2019 [[[1 Nephi 11|1&nbsp;Nephi 11:22\u201323]]; see also [[1 Nephi 8|1&nbsp;Nephi 8:12, 15]]]. [[1 Nephi 11|Chapter 11 of 1&nbsp;Nephi]] presents a detailed description of the tree of life as a symbol for the life, ministry, and sacrifice of the Savior\u2014the \u2018condescension of God\u2019 [[[1 Nephi 11|1&nbsp;Nephi 11:16]]]. The tree can be considered as a representation of Christ.\n\u201cOne way of thinking about the fruit on the tree is as a symbol for the blessings of the Savior\u2019s Atonement. The fruit is described as \u2018desirable to make one happy\u2019 [[[1 Nephi 8|1&nbsp;Nephi 8:10]]] and produces great joy and the desire to share that joy with others.\n\u201cSignificantly, the overarching theme of the Book of Mormon, inviting all to come unto Christ [see [[Moroni 10|Moroni 10:32]]], is paramount in Lehi\u2019s vision [see [[1 Nephi 8|1&nbsp;Nephi 8:19]]]\u201d (\u201cThe Power of His Word Which Is in Us\u201d [address given at seminar for new mission leaders, June&nbsp;27, 2017], 4\u20135)."

I pray that you will seek for the Holy Ghost to guide you in your study as you contemplate the truths taught from this pulpit. They have truly been heaven sent.\nOne week from today is Easter Sunday. It is *the* most important religious observance for followers of Jesus Christ. The main reason we celebrate Christmas is because of Easter. The Come, Follow Me lesson this week will prompt you to study the Savior\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, His cleansing of the temple, His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, His Crucifixion, His glorious Resurrection, and His subsequent appearances to His followers.\nSavor these sacred verses and find every way you can to thank our Heavenly Father for sending us His Only Begotten Son. Because of Jesus Christ, we can repent and be forgiven of our sins. Because of Him, each of us will be resurrected.\nI also invite you to study again the account of the Savior\u2019s appearance to the Nephites in the Americas, as recorded in 3&nbsp;Nephi. Not long before that appearance, His voice was heard among the people, including these words of supplication:\n\u201cWill ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?\n\u201c\u2026 Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive.\u201d\nDear brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ extends that same invitation to you today. I plead with you to come unto Him so that He can heal *you*! He will heal you from sin as you repent. He will heal you from sadness and fear. He will heal you from the wounds of this world.\nWhatever questions or problems you have, the answer is always found in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Learn more about His Atonement, His love, His mercy, His doctrine, and His restored gospel of healing and progression. Turn to Him! Follow Him!\nJesus Christ is the reason we build temples. Each is His holy house. Making covenants and receiving essential ordinances in the temple, as well as seeking to draw closer to Him there, will bless your life in ways no other kind of worship can. For this reason, we are doing all within our power to make the blessings of the temple more accessible to our members around the world. Today, I am grateful to announce our plans to build a new temple in each of the following locations:\n\n\nRetalhuleu, Guatemala\n\n\nIquitos, Peru\n\n\nTeresina, Brazil\n\n\nNatal, Brazil\n\n\nTuguegarao City, Philippines\n\n\nIloilo, Philippines\n\n\nJakarta, Indonesia\n\n\nHamburg, Germany\n\n\nLethbridge, Alberta, Canada\n\n\nSan Jose, California\n\n\nBakersfield, California\n\n\nSpringfield, Missouri\n\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\n\nWinchester, Virginia\n\n\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania\n\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, I bear witness that Jesus Christ directs the affairs of His Church. I testify that following Him is the only way to enduring happiness. I know that His power is descending upon His covenant-keeping people, who are \u201carmed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.\u201d I so testify, with my love and blessing for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",
