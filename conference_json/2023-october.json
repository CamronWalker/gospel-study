Many memorable celebrations were held during that year, and countless expressions of gratitude were offered for the devoted disciples of Jesus Christ who blazed trails, built homes, planted crops in the barren desert, and settled communities.\nPresident J.&nbsp;Reuben Clark, First Counselor in the First Presidency, gave one of the most memorable and touching tributes to these faithful pioneers in the October 1947 general conference.\nIn his message, President Clark briefly acknowledged the well-known leaders who guided the westward migration, such as Brigham Young, Heber&nbsp;C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff, Parley&nbsp;P. Pratt, and many others. However, his primary purpose was not to recount the accomplishments of these noteworthy individuals. Rather, he focused his remarks on the stalwart souls whose names are neither known nor officially recorded in Church history. The instructive title of his message is \u201cThey of the Last Wagon.\u201d\nPresident Clark described in great detail the characteristics of and the challenges faced by the migrants who traveled in the last covered wagon in each of the long wagon trains that crossed the plains. He praised these anonymous and uncelebrated heroes who, day after day, week after week, and month after month, choked on the dust stirred up by all of the wagons rolling in front of them\u2014and who overcame the relentless obstacles they encountered along the way.\nPresident Clark declared, \u201cThey of the last wagon pressed forward, worn and tired, footsore, sometimes almost disheartened, borne up by their faith that God loved them, that the restored gospel was true, and that the Lord led and directed the Brethren out in front.\u201d\nHe concluded his message with this stirring commendation: \u201cTo these humble souls, great in faith, great in work, great in righteous living, great in fashioning our priceless heritage, I humbly render my love, my respect, my reverent homage.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo Less Serviceable\n\nIn 1990, President Howard&nbsp;W. Hunter, then President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, delivered a message about the indispensable contributions of countless Church members who serve diligently and faithfully and who receive little or no public acknowledgment or acclaim.\nPresident Hunter explained:\n\u201cIt was said [about the young and valiant Captain Moroni]:\n\u201c\u2018If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men\u2019 ([[Alma 48|Alma 48:17]]).\n\u201cWhat a compliment to a famous and powerful man. \u2026 Two verses later is a statement about Helaman and his brethren, who played a less conspicuous role than Moroni, that reads:\n\u201c\u2018Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto the people than was Moroni\u2019 ([[Alma 48|Alma 48:19]]).\u201d\nPresident Hunter continued, \u201cIn other words, even though Helaman was not as noticeable or conspicuous as Moroni, he was as serviceable; that is, he was as helpful or useful as Moroni.\u201d\nPresident Hunter then counseled all of us to be no less serviceable. He said: \u201cIf you feel that much of what you do this year or in the years to come does not make you very famous, take heart. Most of the best people who ever lived weren\u2019t very famous either. Serve and grow, faithfully and quietly.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the Path of Their Duty\n\nI am grateful for millions of Church members who today are coming unto the Savior and pressing forward on the covenant path in the last wagons of our contemporary wagon trains\u2014and who truly are no less serviceable. Your strong faith in Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ and your unpretentious, consecrated lives inspire me to be a better man and disciple.\nI love you. I admire you. I thank you. And I commend you.\nA statement in the Book of Mormon by Samuel the Lamanite best summarizes my feelings for you.\n\u201cBehold that the more part of them are *in the path of their duty*, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes. \u2026\n\u201cYea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they are striving with unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the truth.\u201d\nI believe the phrase \u201cin the path of their duty\u201d describes discerning brothers and sisters who look for and sit next to people who are alone in Church meetings and in a variety of other settings. They consistently strive to \u201ccomfort those that stand in need of comfort,\u201d without expectations of acknowledgment or praise.\nThe phrase \u201cin the path of their duty\u201d describes spouses and children who support a companion, parent, or child who serves in a leadership position in the Lord\u2019s restored Church. Their steady, quiet, and typically unrecognized sustaining influence makes possible the blessing of many individuals and families in ways that will be fully known only in eternity.\nThe phrase \u201cin the path of their duty\u201d describes individuals who, having turned away from God, humbly are *re*-turning to Him once again, repenting of their sins, and seeking the cleansing and healing power of the Savior\u2019s Atonement. Coming unto Christ by returning to the covenant path from sinful detours into \u201cforbidden paths\u201d is spiritually essential and righteously rigorous. As they press forward with faith and weary not in well-doing, they are laying the foundation of a great work in their individual lives, \u201cto all generations and for eternity.\u201d\nThe phrase \u201cin the path of their duty\u201d describes righteous individuals who yearn to become yoked to the Savior through the authorized covenants and ordinances of His gospel\u2014but may be prohibited from doing so by factors beyond their control. I promise your personal anguish will be relieved and your obedience and faithfulness to patiently submit your will to God will be rewarded in \u201cthe own due time of the Lord.\u201d \u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\u201d\nThe phrase \u201cin the path of their duty\u201d describes the inspired translators and interpreters around the world who serve the Lord by helping friends and members to \u201chear the fulness of the gospel in [their] own tongue, and in [their] own language.\u201d Their voices, signed language, and translated documents convey eternal truths, yet few of us know their names or ever express appreciation. Through the gift of tongues with which they have been blessed, translators and interpreters serve diligently, selflessly, and, most often, anonymously to help people receive the spiritual gift of faith through reading and hearing the word of God.\nThe phrase \u201cin the path of their duty\u201d describes faithful married men and women who honor their covenant responsibility to multiply and replenish the earth and who are blessed with the strength and stamina to wrestle with their children in sacrament meetings. In an increasingly confused world beset with calamities and misplaced priorities, these courageous souls heed not the secular voices extolling self-centeredness; they reverence the sanctity and importance of life in Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of happiness for His children.\nMany married couples also trust in God when the righteous desires of their hearts are not realized how or when they had hoped and dreamed. They \u201cwait upon the Lord\u201d and do not demand that He meet their mortal deadlines. \u201cFor since the beginning of the world have not men heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath any eye seen, O God, besides thee, how great things thou hast prepared for [them] that waiteth for thee.\u201d\nThe phrase \u201cin the path of their duty\u201d describes the thousands and thousands of nursery leaders and Primary teachers who love and instruct the children of the Church each Sabbath day.\nConsider the eternal impact of the service rendered by these devoted disciples\u2014and the marvelous blessings promised to those who minister to children.\n\u201cAnd [Jesus] took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,\n\u201cWhosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.\u201d\nThe phrase \u201cin the path of their duty\u201d describes dedicated children tenderly caring for aged parents, a sleep-deprived mother comforting a frightened child while standing guard as a \u201clioness at the gate\u201d of her home, Church members who arrive early and stay late to set up and take down chairs, and inspired individuals who invite family, friends, and associates to come and see, come and help, and come and stay.\nI have described only a few selected examples of covenant-keeping and devoted disciples of Jesus Christ like you who are pressing forward \u201cin the path of [your] duty.\u201d Millions of additional examples of Latter-day Saints who offer their \u201cwhole souls\u201d unto God are found in Christ-centered homes and in Church units around the world.\nYou love and serve, listen and learn, care and console, and teach and testify by the power of the Holy Ghost. You fast and pray often, wax stronger and stronger in humility, and grow firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, \u201cunto the filling [your] souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of [your] hearts, which sanctification cometh because of \u2026 yielding [your] hearts unto God.\u201d\n\n\n\nPromise and Testimony\n\nThey of the last wagon, all who are no less serviceable, and you who today are pressing forward in the path of your duty are the strength of the Savior\u2019s restored Church. And as the Lord has promised, \u201call thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nI joyfully witness that Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son live and Their promises are sure, in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.",

After delivering a scathing rebuke of those who were like \u201cwhited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men\u2019s bones, and of all uncleanness,\u201d Jesus taught three more parables about spiritual preparedness and discipleship. One of these was the parable of the ten virgins.\n\u201cThen shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.\n\u201cAnd five of them were wise, and five were foolish.\n\u201cThey that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:\n\u201cBut the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.\n\u201cWhile the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\n\n\u201cAnd at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.\n\u201cThen all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.\n\u201cAnd the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.\n\u201cBut the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.\n\u201cAnd while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.\n\u201cAfterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.\n\u201cBut he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, Ye know me not.\n\u201cWatch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.\u201d\nPresident Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks posed the following thought-provoking questions in relation to the coming of the Bridegroom: \u201cWhat if the day of His coming were tomorrow? If we knew that we would meet the Lord tomorrow\u2014through our premature death or through His unexpected coming\u2014what would we do today?\u201d\nI have learned from personal experience that spiritual preparation for the coming of the Lord is not only essential but the only way to find true peace and happiness.\nIt was a crisp fall day when I first heard the words \u201cYou have cancer.\u201d My husband and I were stunned! As we drove home in silence, processing the news, my heart turned to our three sons.\nIn my mind I asked Heavenly Father, \u201cAm I going to die?\u201d\nThe Holy Ghost whispered, \u201cEverything is going to be OK.\u201d\nThen I asked, \u201cAm I going to live?\u201d\nAgain, the answer came: \u201cEverything is going to be OK.\u201d\nI was confused. Why did I receive the exact same answer whether I lived or died?\nThen suddenly every fiber of my being filled with absolute peace as I was reminded: We did not need to hurry home and teach our children how to pray. They knew how to receive answers and comfort from prayer. We did not need to hurry home and teach them about the scriptures or words of living prophets. Those words were already a familiar source of strength and understanding. We did not need to hurry home and teach them about repentance, the Resurrection, the Restoration, the plan of salvation, eternal families, or the very doctrine of Jesus Christ.\nIn that moment every family home evening lesson, scripture study session, prayer of faith offered, blessing given, testimony shared, covenant made and kept, house of the Lord attended, and Sabbath day observed mattered\u2014oh, how it mattered! It was too late to put oil in our lamps. We needed every single drop, and we needed it right now!\nBecause of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel, if I died, my family would be comforted, strengthened, and one day restored. If I lived, I would have access to the greatest power on this earth to help succor, sustain, and heal me. In the end, because of Jesus Christ, everything can be OK.\n\nWe learn from a careful study of the Doctrine and Covenants what \u201cOK\u201d looks like:\n\u201cAnd at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.\n\u201cFor they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived\u2014verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall *abide the day*.\u201d\nJesus Christ makes it possible for us to \u201cabide the day.\u201d Abiding the day does not mean adding to an ever-increasing to-do list. Think of a magnifying glass. Its sole purpose is not simply to make things appear bigger. It can also gather and focus light to make it more powerful. We need to simplify, focus our efforts, and be gatherers of the Light of Jesus Christ. We need more holy and revelatory experiences.\nLocated in northwestern Israel is a beautiful mountain range often referred to as the \u201cevergreen mountain.\u201d Mount Carmel stays green year-round due largely in part to tiny amounts of dew. Nourishment happens daily. Like \u201cthe dews of Carmel,\u201d as we seek to nourish our souls \u201cwith things pertaining to righteousness,\u201d \u201csmall and simple things,\u201d our testimonies and the testimonies of our children will live!\nNow, you may be thinking, \u201cBut Sister Wright, you do not know my family. We are really struggling and do not look anything like this.\u201d You are correct. I do not know your family. But a God with infinite love, mercy, power, knowledge, and glory does.\nThe questions you may be asking are questions of the heart that ache in the depths of your soul. Similar questions are found in the holy scriptures:\n\u201cMaster, carest thou not that [my family] perish?\u201d\n\u201cWhere is now my hope?\u201d\n\u201cWhat shall [I] do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing [me]?\u201d\n\u201cWhere shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?\u201d\n\u201cHow is it possible that [I] can lay hold upon every good thing?\u201d\n\u201cLord, what wilt thou have me to do?\u201d\nAnd then ever so sweetly come the answers:\n\u201cBelievest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?\u201d\n\u201cHath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve ye that [He is] able to do this?\u201d\n\u201cBelievest thou the prophets?\u201d\n\u201cDo ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you?\u201d\n\u201cShall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\u201d\nMy dear friends, we cannot share our oil, but we can share *His* light. Oil in our lamps will not only help us \u201cabide the day\u201d but can also be the means of illuminating the path that leads those we love to the Savior, who stands ready \u201cwith open arms to receive\u201d them.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, \u2026 and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.\n\u201cAnd there is *hope in thine end*, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border.\u201d\nJesus Christ is the \u201chope in thine end.\u201d Nothing we have or have not done is beyond the reach of His infinite and eternal sacrifice. He is the reason why it is never the end of our story. Therefore we \u201cmust press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if [we] shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: [We] shall have eternal life.\u201d\nEternal life is eternal joy. Joy in this life, *right now*\u2014not despite the challenges of our day but because of the Lord\u2019s help to learn from and ultimately overcome them\u2014*and* immeasurable joy in the life to come. Tears will dry up, broken hearts will be mended, what is lost shall be found, concerns shall be resolved, families will be restored, and all that the Father hath will be ours.\nLook to Jesus Christ and live is my testimony in the sacred and holy name of the beloved \u201cShepherd and Bishop of [our] souls,\u201d Jesus Christ, amen.",

Even the face in the mirror was foreign to him\u2014he couldn\u2019t tell if it was a man or a woman.\nHe\u2019d become face-blind\u2014a condition that affects millions of people.\nPeople who are severely face-blind try to identify others by memorizing rules\u2014a rule for recognizing a daughter by the pattern of her freckles or a friend by her shuffling gait.\n\n\n\nGrowing Up\n\nHere\u2019s a second story, closer to home: As a young boy, I often saw my mom as the rule maker. She decided when I could play and when I had to go to bed or, worse, pull weeds in the yard.\nShe obviously loved me. But too often and to my shame, I saw her only as \u201cShe Who Must Be Obeyed.\u201d\nOnly years later did I come to see her as a real person. I am embarrassed that I never really noticed her sacrifice or wondered why for years she only ever wore the same two old skirts (while I got new school clothes) or why, at the end of the day, she was so tired and eager for me to go to bed early.\n\n\n\nWe May Be Face-Blind\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve noticed that these two stories are really one story\u2014for too many years, I was, in effect, face-blind. I failed to see my mom as a real person. I saw her rules but didn\u2019t see in them her love.\nI tell you these two stories to make one point: I suspect you know someone (perhaps you *are* someone) who suffers from a kind of spiritual face blindness.\nYou may struggle to see God as a loving Father. You may look heavenward and see not the face of love and mercy but a thicket of rules through which you must wend your way. Perhaps you believe God rules in His heavens, speaks through His prophets, and loves your sister, but you secretly wonder whether He loves you. Perhaps you have felt the iron rod in your hand but not yet felt your Savior\u2019s love to which it leads.\nI suspect you know people like this because for a long time, I *was* someone like this\u2014I was spiritually face-blind.\nI thought my life was about following rules and measuring up to abstract standards. I knew God loved *you* perfectly but didn\u2019t feel it myself. I\u2019m afraid I thought more about getting into heaven than being with my Heavenly Father.\nIf you, like me, can sometimes only lip-synch but not \u201csing the song of redeeming love,\u201d what can we do?\nThe answer, as President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson reminds us, is always Jesus. And that is very good news.\n\n\n\nSir, We Would Like to See Jesus\n\nThere\u2019s a short verse in John that I love. It tells of a group of outsiders who make their way to a disciple with an important request. \u201cSir,\u201d they say, \u201cwe would [like to] see Jesus.\u201d\nThat is what we all want\u2014we want to see Jesus for who He is and to feel His love. This should be the reason for most of what we do in the Church\u2014and certainly of every sacrament meeting. If you\u2019re ever wondering what kind of lesson to teach, what kind of meeting to plan, and whether to just give up on the deacons and play dodgeball, you might take this verse as your guide: will this help people see and love Jesus Christ? If not, maybe try something else.\nWhen I realized that I was spiritually face-blind, that I saw rules but not the face of the Father\u2019s mercy, I knew it wasn\u2019t the Church\u2019s fault. It wasn\u2019t God\u2019s, and it didn\u2019t mean everything was lost; it\u2019s something we *all* have to learn. Even the early witnesses to the Resurrection often came face-to-face with the resurrected Lord but did not recognize Him; from the Garden Tomb to the shores of Galilee, His first followers \u201csaw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.\u201d They had to learn to recognize Him, and so do we.\n\n\n\nCharity\n\nWhen I realized I was spiritually face-blind, I started to follow Mormon\u2019s counsel to pray \u201cwith all the energy of heart\u201d to be filled with the love promised His disciples\u2014my love for Him and His love for me\u2014and to \u201csee him as he is \u2026 and have this hope.\u201d I prayed for years to be able to follow the first great commandment to love God and to feel that \u201cfirst great *truth* \u2026 that God loves *us* with all of *His* heart, might, mind, and strength.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Gospels\n\nI also read and reread and reread the four Gospels\u2014this time reading not to extract rules but to see who He is and what He loves. And, in time, I was swept away by the river of love that flowed from Him.\nJesus announced at the outset that He had come \u201cto heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind.\u201d\nThis wasn\u2019t just a to-do list or good PR; it is the shape of His love.\nOpen the Gospels at random; on almost every page we see Him caring for people who suffer\u2014socially, spiritually, and physically. He touches people considered polluted and unclean and feeds the hungry.\nWhat is your favorite story of Jesus? I suspect it shows the Son of God reaching out to embrace or offer hope to someone on the margins\u2014the leper, the hated Samaritan, the accused and scandalous sinner, or the national enemy. That kind of grace is amazing.\nTry writing down every time He praises or heals or eats with an outsider, and you will run low on ink before you leave Luke.\nAs I saw this, my heart leapt in loving recognition, and I began to feel that He might love me. As President Nelson taught, \u201cThe more you learn about the Savior, the easier it will be to trust in His mercy, His infinite love.\u201d And the more you will trust and love your Heavenly Father.\nElder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland has taught us that Jesus came to show \u201cus who and what God our Eternal Father is like, how completely devoted He is to His children in every age and nation.\u201d\nPaul says God is \u201cthe Father of [all] mercies, and the God of all comfort.\u201d\nIf you see Him differently, please keep trying.\n\n\n\nCovenants and God\u2019s Embrace\n\nProphets invite us to seek His face. I take this as a reminder that we worship our Father, not a formula, and that we\u2019re not finished until we see Jesus as the face of our Father\u2019s love and follow Him, not just His rules.\nWhen prophets and apostles talk of covenants, they aren\u2019t like coaches yelling out from (red velvet) bleachers, telling us to \u201ctry harder!\u201d They want us to see our covenants are fundamentally about relationships and can be a cure for spiritual face blindness. They are not rules to earn His love; He already loves you perfectly. Our challenge is to understand and shape our life to that love.\nWe try to see through our covenants, as if through a window, to the face of the Father\u2019s mercy behind.\nCovenants are the shape of God\u2019s embrace.\n\n\n\nThe River of God\u2019s Love\n\nFinally, we can learn to see Him by serving Him. \u201cFor how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served?\u201d\nA few years ago, I got a calling I didn\u2019t feel up to. I awoke early, nervous\u2014but with a phrase in mind I had not heard before: that to serve in this Church is to stand in the river of God\u2019s love for His children. This Church is a work party of people with picks and shovels trying to help clear the channel for the river of God\u2019s love to reach His children at the end of the row.\nWhoever you are, whatever your past, there is room for you in this Church.\nGrab a pick and shovel and join the team. Help carry His love to His children, and some of it will splash on you.\nLet us seek His loving face, His covenant embrace, and then join arm in arm with His children, and together we will sing \u201cRedeemer of Israel\u201d:\n\n\nRestore, my dear Savior,\nThe light of thy face;\nThy soul-cheering comfort impart;\nAnd let the sweet longing\nFor thy holy place\nBring hope to my desolate heart.\n\n\nMay we seek His loving face and then be vessels of His mercy to His children. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

After finally completing the airport immigration process, I found a friendly taxi driver waiting for me from our usual taxi service. He took me to his car, and I sat in the back, ready to relax and enjoy a quiet trip home. After driving a few blocks, the driver received a phone call from his supervisor telling him I took the wrong taxi. A different car was reserved for me, and the supervisor asked him to take me back to the airport if I wanted to change cars. I told him it was not necessary, and we could keep going. After a few minutes of silence, he looked at me through the rearview mirror and asked, \u201cYou are a Mormon, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nWell, after that inviting question, I knew my quiet moments were over. I could not resist exploring where his question would take us.\nI learned that his name was Omar, his wife\u2019s name was Maria Teresa, and they had two children\u2014Carolina, age 14, and Rodrigo, age 10. Omar had been a member of the Church since he was a child. His family was active, but at some point, his parents stopped going to church. Omar became completely inactive when he was 15. He was then 40 years old.\nAt that moment I realized I did *not* take the wrong taxi. *It was not a coincidence!* I told him who I was and that I was in his taxi because the Lord was calling him back to His fold.\nWe then talked about the time he and his family were active members of the Church. He had fond memories of sweet family home evening moments and some Primary songs. He then softly sang a few words of \u201cI Am a Child of God.\u201d\nAfter getting his address, phone number, and permission to share with his bishop, I told him I would find a way to be in the chapel on his first day back to church. We finished our trip from the airport to my home, as well as our little trip to his past, and we went our separate ways.\nA few weeks later his bishop called me, telling me Omar was planning to attend church on a certain Sunday. I told him I would be there. That Sunday, Omar was there with his son. His wife and daughter were not yet interested. A few months later, his bishop called me again, this time to tell me that Omar would be baptizing his wife and his two children, and he invited me to be there. Here is the picture of that Sunday where they were confirmed members of the Church.\n\nThat same Sunday, I told Omar and his family that if they were prepared, in one year I would be honored to perform their sealing in the Lima Peru Temple. Here is a picture of that memorable moment for all of us, taken one year later.\n\nWhy am I sharing this experience with you? I am sharing it for two purposes.\nFirst, to address those good members who for some reason have fallen away from the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Second, to also address those participating members today who maybe are not being as faithful to their covenants as they should be. In both cases, generations ahead of them are impacted, and blessings and promises that were reserved for their posterities are at risk.\nLet\u2019s start with the first scenario, good members who have left the covenant path, as happened with my Peruvian friend Omar. When I asked him why he decided to return, he said it was because he and his wife felt their children would be happier in life with the gospel of Jesus Christ. He felt it was about time to go back to church for the sake of their children.\nIt is so sad when we come across inactive members or nonmembers of the Church who at one time had the gospel within their families and lost it because of their parents\u2019 or grandparents\u2019 decision to take a break from the Church. That decision could have an impact on their posterity forever!\nTheir children and grandchildren have been precluded from the protection and the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ in their lives. Even more heartbreaking, they have lost the promises of an eternal family which were there one day. The decision of one has impacted a whole chain of descendants. A legacy of faith has been broken.\nHowever, as we know, anything broken can be mended through Jesus Christ. For this reason, please consider this invitation from President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson: \u201cNow, if you have stepped off the path, may I invite you with all the hope in my heart to please come back. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there is a place for you in this, the Lord\u2019s Church. *You and generations yet unborn will be blessed by your actions now to return to the covenant path*.\u201d\nNow, let\u2019s address the second scenario, today\u2019s participating members who maybe are not being as faithful as they should be. Just as yesterday\u2019s decisions impact today\u2019s realities, decisions of today will impact our future and the future of our family members.\nPresident Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks taught us:\n\u201cThe restored gospel of Jesus Christ encourages us to think about the future. \u2026 It teaches great ideas about the future to guide our actions today.\n\u201cIn contrast, we all know persons who are concerned only with the present: spend it today, enjoy it today, and take no thought for the future.\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;As we make current decisions, we should always be asking, \u2018*Where will this lead?*\u2019\u201d Will our current decisions lead us to joy now and in eternity, or will they lead us to sorrow and tears?\nSome may think, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to attend church every Sunday,\u201d or \u201cWe will pay tithing when things get better,\u201d or \u201cI will not support the Church leaders in this subject.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d they say, \u201cwe know the Church is true, and we will never leave the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nThose with thoughts like these do not realize the negative impact this \u201clukewarm\u201d type of membership will have on their lives and on the lives of their posterity. The parents may remain active, but the risk of losing their children is high\u2014in this life and in eternity.\nRegarding those who will not inherit celestial glory with their families, the Lord says, \u201cThese are they who are not *valiant* in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God.\u201d Is that what we want for ourselves or our children? Shouldn\u2019t we be more *valiant* and less *lukewarm* for our own sake and for the sake of our posterity?\nPresident M.&nbsp;Russell Ballard also addressed a similar concern:\n\u201cFor some, Christ\u2019s invitation to believe and remain continues to be hard.&nbsp;\u2026 Some disciples struggle to understand a specific Church policy or teaching. Others find concerns in our history or in the imperfections of some members and leaders, past and present.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;The decision to \u2018walk no more\u2019 with Church members and the Lord\u2019s chosen leaders will have a *long-term impact* that cannot always be seen right now.\u201d\nWhat a sad legacy to pass along\u2014and for what reason? Whatever it is, it isn\u2019t enough to ignore the negative spiritual impact it will create for generations ahead.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, if you are going through one of these two situations I mentioned in my message, please reconsider your course of action. You know there is a plan for us in this life. You know that families can be eternal. Why put yours at risk? Don\u2019t be the weak link in this beautiful chain of faith you started, or you received, as a legacy. Be the strong one. It is your turn to do it, and the Lord can help you.\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I invite you to think about it, to look ahead and evaluate \u201cwhere this will lead,\u201d and, if necessary, to be valiant enough to reshape your path for the sake of your posterity. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Nelson has spoken often and powerfully about this gathering, calling it \u201cthe most important thing taking place on earth today.\u201d\nWhat is the purpose of this gathering?\nBy revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord identified one purpose as the protection of the covenant people. He said, \u201cThe gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, [will] be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.\u201d \u201cWrath\u201d in this context may be understood as the natural consequences of widespread disobedience to the laws and commandments of God.\nMost importantly, the gathering is for the purpose of bringing the blessings of salvation and exaltation to all who will receive them. It is how the covenant promises given to Abraham are realized. The Lord told Abraham that through his seed and priesthood \u201call the families of the earth [should] be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal.\u201d President Nelson expressed it this way: \u201cWhen we embrace the gospel and are baptized, we take upon ourselves the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Baptism is the gate that leads to becoming joint heirs to all the promises given anciently by the Lord to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their posterity.\u201d\nIn 1836, Moses appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple and \u201ccommitted \u2026 the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth.\u201d On that same occasion, Elias appeared and \u201ccommitted the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all generations after us should be blessed.\u201d With this authority, we now carry the gospel of Jesus Christ\u2014the good news of redemption through Him\u2014to all parts and peoples of the earth and gather all who will into the gospel covenant. They become \u201cthe seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.\u201d\nOn that same occasion in the Kirtland Temple, there was a third heavenly messenger who appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. I speak of the prophet Elijah, and it is the authority and keys he restored that I want to speak about today. The power to validate all priesthood ordinances and make them binding both on earth and in heaven\u2014the sealing power\u2014is crucial for gathering and preparing a covenant people on both sides of the veil.\nYears earlier, Moroni had made it clear to Joseph Smith that Elijah would bring essential priesthood authority: \u201cI will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet.\u201d Joseph Smith later explained: \u201cWhy send Elijah? Because he holds the keys of the authority to administer in all the ordinances of the Priesthood; and [unless] the authority is given, the ordinances could not be administered in righteousness\u201d\u2014that is, the ordinances would not be valid in both time and eternity.\nIn a teaching now canonized as scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants, the Prophet stated: \u201cIt may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of\u2014a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the priesthood to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power has always been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in the name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah.\u201d\nWe tend to think of the sealing authority as applying only to certain temple ordinances, but that authority is necessary to make any ordinance valid and binding beyond death. The sealing power confers a seal of legitimacy upon your baptism, for example, so that it is recognized here and in heaven. Ultimately, all priesthood ordinances are performed under the keys of the President of the Church, and as President Joseph Fielding Smith explained, \u201cHe [the President of the Church] has given us authority, he has put the sealing power in our priesthood, because he holds those keys.\u201d\nThere is another vital purpose in the gathering of Israel that has special meaning when we talk about sealing on earth and in heaven\u2014that is the building and operation of temples. As the Prophet Joseph Smith explained: \u201cWhat was the object of gathering the \u2026 people of God in any age of the world? \u2026 The main object was to build unto the Lord a house whereby He could reveal unto His people the ordinances of His house and the glories of His kingdom, and teach the people the way of salvation; for there are certain ordinances and principles that, when they are taught and practiced, must be done in a place or house built for that purpose.\u201d\nThe validity that the sealing power gives to priesthood ordinances includes, of course, vicarious ordinances performed in the place designated by the Lord\u2014His temple. Here we see the majesty and sacredness of the sealing power\u2014it makes individual salvation and family exaltation universally available to the children of God wherever and whenever they may have lived on the earth. No other theology or philosophy or authority can match such an all-inclusive opportunity. This sealing power is a perfect manifestation of the justice, mercy, and love of God.\nWith access to the sealing power, our hearts naturally turn to those who have gone before. The latter-day gathering into the covenant crosses through the veil. In the perfect order of God, the living cannot experience eternal life in its fulness without forging enduring links to \u201cthe fathers,\u201d our ancestors. Likewise, the progress of those who are already on the other side, or who may yet cross through the veil of death without the benefit of sealings, is incomplete until vicarious ordinances bind them to us, their descendants, and us to them in the divine order. The commitment to aid one another across the veil can be classified as a covenant promise, part of the new and everlasting covenant. In Joseph Smith\u2019s words, we want to \u201cseal up our dead to come forth [with us] in the first resurrection.\u201d\nThe highest and holiest manifestation of the sealing power is in the eternal union of a man and a woman in marriage and the linking of humankind through all their generations. Because the authority to officiate in these ordinances is so sacred, the President of the Church personally oversees its delegation to others. President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley said on one occasion, \u201cI have said many times that if nothing else came out of all of the sorrow and travail and pain of the restoration than the sealing power of the holy priesthood to bind together families forever, it would have been worth all that it has cost.\u201d\nWithout the sealings that create eternal families and link generations here and hereafter, we would be left in eternity with neither roots nor branches\u2014that is, neither ancestry nor posterity. It is this free-floating, disconnected state of individuals, on the one hand, or connections that defy the marriage and family relations God has appointed, on the other hand, that would frustrate the very purpose of the earth\u2019s creation. Were that to become the norm, it would be tantamount to the earth being smitten with a curse or \u201cutterly wasted\u201d at the Lord\u2019s coming.\nWe can see why \u201cmarriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator\u2019s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.\u201d At the same time, we recognize that in the imperfect present, this is not the reality or even a realistic possibility for some. But we have hope in Christ. While we wait upon the Lord, President M.&nbsp;Russell Ballard reminds us that \u201cscriptures and latter-day prophets confirm that everyone who is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation.\u201d\nSome have experienced unhappy and unhealthy family circumstances and feel little desire for an eternal family association. Elder David&nbsp;A. Bednar made this observation: \u201cTo you who have experienced the heartache of a divorce in your family or felt the agony of violated trust, please remember [that God\u2019s pattern for families] begins again with you! One link in the chain of your generations may have been broken, but the other righteous links and what remains of the chain are nonetheless eternally important. You can add strength to your chain and perhaps even help to restore the broken links. That work will be accomplished one by one.\u201d\nIn the funeral services for Sister Pat Holland, wife of Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland, last July, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught: \u201cIn time, Patricia and Jeffrey will be reunited. They will later be joined by their children and their covenant-keeping posterity to experience the fulness of joy that God has in store for His faithful children. Knowing that, we understand that the most important date in Patricia\u2019s life was not her birth date or her death date. Her most important date was June&nbsp;7, 1963, when she and Jeff were sealed in the St.&nbsp;George Temple. \u2026 Why is this so important? Because the very reason the earth was created was so families could be formed and sealed to each other. Salvation is an individual matter, but exaltation is a family matter. No one can be exalted alone.\u201d\nNot long ago, my wife and I joined a dear friend in a sealing room of the Bountiful Utah Temple. I first met this friend when she was a child in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. My missionary companion and I were contacting people in a neighborhood just blocks away from the mission office, and she answered the door when we came to her home. In due time, she and her mother and siblings joined the Church, and they have remained faithful members. She is now a lovely woman, and this day we were in the temple to seal her deceased parents to one another and then seal her to them.\nA couple who over the years have become close friends represented her parents at the altar. It was an emotional moment that became even sweeter when our Argentine friend was sealed to her parents. There were just six of us present on a quiet afternoon away from the world, and yet one of the most important things that ever takes place on the earth was happening. I was gratified that my role and association had come full circle from knocking on her door as a young missionary to now, these many years later, performing the sealing ordinances that linked her to her parents and past generations.\nThis is a scene taking place constantly all over the world in temples. This is the ultimate step in gathering the covenant people. It is the highest privilege of your membership in the Church of Jesus Christ. I promise that as you faithfully seek that privilege, in time or eternity it will surely be yours.\nI testify that the sealing power and authority restored to earth through Joseph Smith are real, that what is thereby bound on earth truly is bound in heaven. I testify that President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, as President of the Church, is the one man on earth today that by his keys directs the use of this supernal power. I testify that the Atonement of Jesus Christ has made immortality a verity and the possibility of exalted family relationships a reality. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

You won\u2019t see any lions, zebras, or elephants, but perhaps, by journey\u2019s end, you will see how thousands of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are responding to Christ\u2019s second great commandment to \u201clove thy neighbour\u201d ([[Mark 12|Mark 12:31]]).\nImagine for a moment the rural, red dirt of Africa. You see from the parched and barren earth that rain has not fallen in any measurable quantity for too many years. The few cattle which cross your path are more bones than flesh and are being driven by a blanket-covered Karamojong herdsman who, with sandalled feet, trudges on in hope of finding vegetation and water.\nAs you navigate the rough and rocky road, you see several groups of beautiful children and wonder why they are not in school. The children smile and wave, and you wave back with a tear and a smile. Ninety-two percent of the youngest children you see on this journey live in food poverty, and your heart groans with anguish.\nAhead, you see a mother carrying a carefully balanced five-gallon (19 L) container of water on her head and another in her hand. She represents one of every two households in this area where women, young and old, walk more than 30 minutes each way, each day, to a source of water for their family. A wave of sorrow washes over you.\n\nTwo hours pass and you arrive at a secluded, shady clearing. The meeting place is not a hall or even a tent but rather under a few large trees providing shelter from the sweltering sun. In this place, you notice there is no running water, no electricity, no flush toilets. You look around and know you are amongst a people who love God, and you instantly feel God\u2019s love for them. They have gathered to receive help and hope, and you have arrived to share it.\nSuch was the journey of Sister Ardern and me, in the company of Sister Camille Johnson, our General Relief Society President, and her husband, Doug, and Sister Sharon Eubank, director of the Church\u2019s Humanitarian Services, as we travelled in Uganda, a country of 47 million people in the Africa Central Area of the Church. On that day, under the shade of the trees, we visited a community health project that is jointly funded by the Church Humanitarian Services, UNICEF, and the Ministry of Health of the Ugandan government. These are trusted organisations, carefully selected to ensure the donated humanitarian funds of the members of the Church are prudently used.\n\nAs heart-wrenching as it was to see malnourished children and the effects of tuberculosis, malaria, and incessant diarrhea, there came to each of us an increase of hope for a better tomorrow for those we met.\n\nThat hope came, in part, through the kindness of Church members from around the world who donate time and money to the Church humanitarian effort. As I saw the sick and the afflicted being helped and lifted, I bowed my head in gratitude. At that moment, I better understood what was meant by the King of kings, who said:\n\u201cCome, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you \u2026&nbsp;:\n\u201cFor I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in\u201d ([[Matthew 25|Matthew 25:34\u201335]]).\nOur Saviour\u2019s plea is to \u201clet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\u201d ([[Matthew 5|Matthew 5:16]]; see also verses [[Matthew 5|14\u201315]]). In that far-flung corner of the earth, your good works brightened the lives and lightened the load of a people in desperate need, and God was glorified.\nOn that hot and dusty day, I wished you could have heard their prayers of praise and gratitude to God. They would have me say to you in their native Karamojong, \u201cAlakara.\u201d Thank you.\nOur journey reminded me of the parable of the good Samaritan, whose journey took him on a dusty road, not unlike the one I described, a road that went from Jerusalem to Jericho. This ministering Samaritan teaches us what it means to \u201clove thy neighbour.\u201d\nHe saw \u201ca certain man \u2026 [who] fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead\u201d ([[Luke 10|Luke 10:30]]). The Samaritan \u201chad compassion on him\u201d ([[Luke 10|Luke 10:33]]).\nCompassion is an attribute of Christ. It is born of love for others and knows no boundaries. Jesus, the Saviour of the world, is the epitome of compassion. When we read that \u201cJesus wept\u201d ([[John 11|John 11:35]]), we are witnesses, as were Mary and Martha, of His compassion, which caused Him first to *groan in the spirit and be troubled* (see [[John 11|John 11:33]]). In a Book of Mormon example of Christ\u2019s compassion, Jesus appeared to a multitude and said:\n\u201cHave ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, \u2026 or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026 And he did heal them every one\u201d ([[3 Nephi 17|3&nbsp;Nephi 17:7, 9]]).\nDespite our every effort, you and I won\u2019t heal everyone, but each of us can be the one who can make a difference for good in the life of someone. It was just one lad, a mere boy, who offered the five loaves and two fishes that fed the five thousand. We may ask of our offering, as Andrew the disciple did of the loaves and fishes, \u201cWhat are they among so many?\u201d ([[John 6|John 6:9]]). I assure you: it is sufficient to give or to do what you are able and then to allow Christ to magnify your effort.\nOn this point, Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland invited us, \u201crich *or* poor, \u2026 to \u2018do what we can\u2019 when others are in need.\u201d He then testified, as I do, that God \u201cwill help you and guide you in [your] compassionate acts of discipleship\u201d (\u201c[Are We Not All Beggars?](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2014/10/are-we-not-all-beggars?lang=eng&amp;id=p19#p19),\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 41).\nIn that distant land, on that unforgettable day, I stood then and stand now as a witness of the soul-stirring and life-changing compassion of members of the Church, both rich and poor.\nThe parable of the good Samaritan continues as he \u201cbound up [the man\u2019s] wounds \u2026 and took care of him\u201d ([[Luke 10|Luke 10:34]]). Our Church humanitarian efforts find us quickly responding to natural disasters and binding up the world\u2019s widening wounds of disease, hunger, infant mortality, malnutrition, displacement, and the often-unseen wounds of discouragement, disappointment, and despair.\nThe Samaritan then \u201ctook out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him\u201d ([[Luke 10|Luke 10:35]]). As a church we are grateful to collaborate with other \u201chosts\u201d or organisations such as Catholic Relief Services, UNICEF, and Red Cross/Red Crescent to assist in our humanitarian endeavours. We are equally grateful for your \u201ctwo pence\u201d or two euros, two pesos, or two shillings that are easing the burden that too many around the world are having to bear. It is unlikely you will know the recipients of your time, dollars, and dimes, but compassion does not require us to know them; it only requires us to love them.\nThank you, President Russell M. Nelson, for reminding us that \u201cwhen we love *God* with all our hearts, He turns our hearts to the well-being of *others*\u201d (\u201c[The Second Great Commandment](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/10/46nelson?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11),\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2019, 97). I testify that each of us will have an increase of joy, peace, humility, and love as we respond to President Nelson\u2019s call to turn our hearts to the well-being of others and to Joseph Smith\u2019s plea to \u201cfeed the hungry, clothe the naked, provide for the widow, dry up the tear of the orphan, [and] comfort the afflicted, whether in this Church, or any other, or in no church at all, wherever [we find] them\u201d (\u201cEditor\u2019s Reply to a Letter from Richard Savary,\u201d Times and Seasons, Mar.&nbsp;15, 1842, 732).\n\nAll those months ago, we found the hungry and the afflicted on a dry and dusty plain and were witnesses to their pleading eyes for help. In our own way, we *groaned in the spirit and were troubled* (see [[John 11|John 11:33]]), and yet those feelings were tempered as we saw the compassion of Church members at work as the hungry were fed, the widows were provided for, and the afflicted were comforted and their tears dried up.\nMay we be forever looking to the well-being of others and show in word and deed that we \u201care willing to bear one another\u2019s burdens\u201d ([[Mosiah 18|Mosiah 18:8]]), to \u201cbind up the broken-hearted\u201d ([[D&C 138|Doctrine and Covenants 138:42]]), and to keep Christ\u2019s second great commandment to \u201clove thy neighbour\u201d ([[Mark 12|Mark 12:31]]). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

I assure you: it is sufficient to give or to do what you are able and then to allow Christ to magnify your effort."

        "full_markdown": "Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are frequently asked, \u201cHow is your church different from other Christian churches?\u201d Among the answers we give is the fulness of the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Foremost among that doctrine is the fact that our Heavenly Father loves all His children so much that He wants us all to live in a kingdom of glory forever. Moreover, He wants us to live with Him and His Son, Jesus Christ, eternally. His plan gives us the teachings and the opportunity to make the choices that will assure us the destiny and the life we choose.\n\n\nI.\n\nFrom modern revelation we know that the ultimate destiny of all who live on the earth is not the inadequate idea of heaven for the righteous and the eternal sufferings of hell for the rest. God\u2019s loving plan for His children includes this reality taught by our Savior, Jesus Christ: \u201cIn my Father\u2019s house are many mansions.\u201d\nThe revealed doctrine of the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that *all the children of God*\u2014with exceptions too limited to consider here\u2014will ultimately inherit one of three kingdoms of glory, even the least of which \u201csurpasses all understanding.\u201d After a period in which the disobedient suffer for their sins, which suffering prepares them for what is to follow, all will be resurrected and proceed to the Final Judgment of the Lord Jesus Christ. There, our loving Savior, who, we are taught, \u201cglorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands,\u201d will send all the children of God to one of these kingdoms of glory according to the desires manifested through their choices.\nAnother unique doctrine and practice of the restored Church is the revealed commandments and covenants that offer *all the children of God* the sacred privilege of qualifying for the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom. That highest destination\u2014exaltation in the celestial kingdom\u2014is the focus of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nFrom modern revelation, Latter-day Saints have this unique understanding of God\u2019s plan of happiness for His children. That plan begins with our life as spirits before we were born, and it reveals the purpose and conditions of our chosen journey in mortality and our desired destination thereafter.\n\n\n\nII.\n\nWe know from modern revelation that \u201call kingdoms have a law given\u201d and that the kingdom of glory we receive in the Final Judgment is determined by the laws we choose to follow in our mortal journey. Under that loving plan, there are multiple kingdoms\u2014many mansions\u2014so that all of God\u2019s children will inherit a kingdom of glory whose laws they can comfortably \u201cabide.\u201d\nAs we describe the nature and requirements of each of the three kingdoms in the Father\u2019s plan, we begin with the highest, which is the focus of the divine commandments and ordinances God has revealed through The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In the \u201ccelestial\u201d glory there are three levels, of which the highest is exaltation in the celestial kingdom. This is the dwelling of those \u201cwho have received of his fulness, and of his glory,\u201d wherefore, \u201cthey are gods, even the sons [and daughters] of God\u201d and \u201cdwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.\u201d Through revelation, God has revealed the eternal laws, ordinances, and covenants that must be observed to develop the godly attributes necessary to realize this divine potential. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints focuses on these because the purpose of this restored Church is to prepare God\u2019s children for salvation in the celestial glory and, more particularly, for exaltation in its highest degree.\nGod\u2019s plan, founded on eternal truth, requires that exaltation can be attained only through faithfulness to the covenants of an eternal marriage between a man and a woman in the holy temple, which marriage will ultimately be available to all the faithful. That is why we teach that \u201cgender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.\u201d\nA uniquely valuable teaching to help us prepare for exaltation is the 1995 proclamation on the family. Its declarations clarify the requirements that prepare us to live with God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Those who do not fully understand the Father\u2019s loving plan for His children may consider this family proclamation no more than a changeable statement of policy. In contrast, we affirm that the family proclamation, founded on irrevocable doctrine, defines the mortal family relationship where the most important part of our eternal development can occur.\nThe Apostle Paul describes the three degrees of glory, likening them to the glories of the sun, moon, and stars. He names the highest \u201ccelestial\u201d and the second \u201cterrestrial.\u201d He does not name the lowest, but a revelation to Joseph Smith added its name: \u201ctelestial.\u201d Another revelation also describes the nature of the persons to be assigned to each of these kingdoms of glory. Those who do not choose \u201cto abide the law of a celestial kingdom\u201d will inherit another kingdom of glory, lesser than the celestial but suited to the laws they have chosen and can comfortably \u201cabide.\u201d That word *abide*, so common in the scriptures, means a secure placement. For example, those in the terrestrial kingdom\u2014comparable to the popular concept of heaven\u2014\u201care they who receive of the presence of the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father.\u201d They were \u201chonorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men,\u201d but \u201cnot valiant in the testimony of Jesus.\u201d\nThe revealing description of those assigned to the lowest of the kingdoms of glory, the telestial, is \u201che who cannot abide \u2026 a terrestrial glory.\u201d That describes those who reject the Savior and have observed no divine limits on their behavior. This is the kingdom where the wicked abide, after they have suffered for their sins. These are described in modern revelation as \u201cthey who received not the gospel of Christ, neither the testimony of Jesus.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cThese are they who are liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie.\u201d\nSpeaking of the three kingdoms of glory with his prophetic vision, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson recently wrote: \u201cMortal lifetime is barely a nanosecond compared with eternity. But what a crucial nanosecond it is! Consider carefully how it works: During this mortal life you get to choose which laws you are willing to obey\u2014those of the celestial kingdom, or the terrestrial, or the telestial\u2014and, therefore, in which kingdom of glory you will live forever. What a plan! It is a plan that completely honors *your* agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe Apostle Paul taught that the Lord\u2019s teachings and commandments were given that we may all attain \u201cthe measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\u201d That process requires far more than acquiring knowledge. It is not even enough to be *convinced* of the gospel; we must act so that we are *converted* by it. In contrast to other preaching, which teaches us to *know* something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to *become* something.\nFrom such teachings we conclude that the Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts\u2014what we have *done*. It is based on the final effect of our acts and thoughts\u2014what we have *become*. We qualify for eternal life through a process of *conversion*. As used here, this word of many meanings signifies a profound change of nature. It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nBecause of Jesus Christ and His Atonement, when we fall short in this life, we can repent and rejoin the covenant path that leads to what our Heavenly Father desires for us.\nThe Book of Mormon teaches that \u201cthis life is the time for [us] to prepare to meet God.\u201d But that challenging limitation to \u201cthis life\u201d was given a hopeful context (at least to some extent for some persons) by what the Lord revealed to President Joseph&nbsp;F. Smith, now recorded in [[D&C 138|Doctrine and Covenants section 138]]. \u201cI beheld,\u201d the prophet wrote, \u201cthat the faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.\n\u201cThe dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances of the house of God,\n\u201cAnd after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions, and are washed clean, shall receive a reward according to their works, for they are heirs of salvation.\u201d\nIn addition, we know that the Millennium, the thousand years that follow the Second Coming of the Savior, will be a time to perform the required ordinances for those who have not received them in their mortal lives.\nThere is much we do not know about the three major periods in the plan of salvation and their relationship to one another: (1)&nbsp;the premortal spirit world, (2)&nbsp;mortality, and (3)&nbsp;the next life. But we do know these eternal truths: \u201cSalvation is an individual matter, but exaltation is a family matter.\u201d We have a loving Heavenly Father who will see that we receive every blessing and every advantage that our own desires and choices allow. We also know that He will force no one into a sealing relationship against his or her will. The blessings of a sealed relationship are assured for all who keep their covenants but never by forcing a sealed relationship on another person who is unworthy or unwilling.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, I testify of the truth of these things. I testify of our Lord Jesus Christ, \u201cthe author and finisher of our faith,\u201d whose Atonement, under the plan of our Father in Heaven, makes it all possible, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "While I was in South America recently, Brother Roger Parra from Venezuela shared the following experience with me:\n\u201cIn 2019 Venezuela was shaken by problems that caused a power blackout for five days.\n\u201cChaos and anarchy reigned in the streets, and many desperate people did not have sufficient food.\n\u201cSome began looting food businesses, destroying everything in their path.\n\u201cAs the owner of a small bakery, I was very worried about our business. As a family, we decided to give away all the food in our bakery to people in need.\n\u201cThrough one very dark night riots were everywhere. My only concern was for the safety of my beloved wife and children.\n\u201cAt dawn I went to our bakery. Sadly, every nearby food business had been destroyed by looters, but to my great astonishment, our bakery was intact. Nothing had been destroyed. I humbly thanked my Heavenly Father.\n\u201cArriving home, I told my family of God\u2019s blessing and protection.\n\u201cThey were all so grateful.\n\u201cMy oldest son, Rogelio, only 12&nbsp;years old, said, \u2018Papa! I know why our store was protected. You and Mama always pay your tithes.\u2019\u201d\nBrother Parra concluded: \u201cThe words of Malachi came into my mind. \u2018I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground\u2019 [[[Malachi 3|Malachi 3:11]]]. We knelt down and gratefully thanked our Heavenly Father for His miracle.\u201d\n\n\n\nProve Me Now Herewith\n\nAll that we have and all that we are comes from God. As disciples of Christ, we willingly share with those around us.\nWith all the Lord gives to us, He has asked us to return to Him and His kingdom on earth 10&nbsp;percent of our increase. He has promised us that as we are honest in our tithes, He will \u201copen \u2026 the windows of heaven, and pour \u2026 out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d He has promised us that He will protect us from evil. These promises are so certain, the Lord declares, \u201cProve me now herewith,\u201d a phrase found nowhere else in the scriptures but when quoting Malachi.\nThe windows of heaven open in many ways. Some are temporal, but many are spiritual. Some are subtle and easy to overlook. Trust in the Lord\u2019s timing; the blessings always come.\nWe sorrow with those who struggle to have the necessities of life. The Church recently donated 54 million US dollars to provide relief to vulnerable children and mothers across the world. And with the offerings from your monthly fast, our good bishops help thousands each week who temporarily need food on their tables, clothes on their backs, and shelter over their heads. The only permanent solution to the poverty of this world is the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nA Matter of Faith\n\nThe Apostle Paul warned that the wisdom of men understands the things of men but has difficulty understanding the things of God. The world speaks of tithing in terms of our money, but the sacred law of tithing is principally a matter of our faith. Being honest in our tithes is one way we show our willingness to put the Lord first in our lives, above our own cares and interest. I promise you that as you trust in the Lord, the blessings of heaven will follow.\nJesus said to give \u201cunto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s; and unto God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d The resurrected Savior asked the Nephites to write into their record His promises found in Malachi. In our day, the Lord reconfirmed the divine law of tithing, declaring: \u201cThis shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people. And [they] shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever.\u201d\nThe Lord clearly directed how tithing should be disbursed, saying, \u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,\u201d meaning bring the tithes into His restored kingdom, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He directed that the use of these sacred tithes would be prayerfully considered by a council of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Presiding Bishopric, \u201cand by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Lord\u2019s Sacred Funds\n\nThese sacred funds do not belong to the leaders of the Church. They belong to the Lord. His servants are painstakingly aware of the sacred nature of their stewardship.\nPresident Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley recounted this childhood experience: \u201cWhen I was a boy I raised a question with my father \u2026 concerning the expenditure of Church funds. He reminded me that mine is the God-given obligation to pay my tithes and offerings. When I do so, [my father said,] that which I give is no longer mine. It belongs to the Lord to whom I consecrate it.\u201d His father added: \u201cWhat the authorities of the Church do with it need not concern [you, Gordon]. They are answerable to the Lord, who will require an accounting at their hands.\u201d\nWe deeply feel the weight of being \u201canswerable to the Lord.\u201d\n\n\n\nYour Generous Tithes and Offerings\n\nFrom the generous tithes and offerings you have consecrated to the Lord, last year more than a billion US dollars were used to bless those in need.\nIn our momentous responsibility to take the restored gospel across the world, we have more than 71,000 missionaries serving in 414 missions. Because of your tithes and offerings, missionaries, regardless of their family financial situation, are able to serve.\nTemples are being built across the world in unprecedented numbers. Currently, 177&nbsp;temples are in operation, 59 are currently under construction or renovation, and 79 more are in planning and design. Your tithes are allowing the blessings of the temple to be in places only the Lord could foresee.\nThere are more than 30,000&nbsp;congregations housed in thousands of chapels and other facilities in 195&nbsp;countries and territories. Because of your faithful tithes, the Church is being established in faraway places you may never visit among righteous Saints you may never know.\nThe Church currently sponsors five institutions of higher learning. These serve more than 145,000&nbsp;students. One hundred and ten thousand classes are being taught each week in our seminaries and institutes.\nThese blessings and so many more come in large measure from the young and old of every economic circumstance who pay an honest tithe.\nThe spiritual power of the divine law of tithing is not measured by the amount of money contributed, for both the prosperous and the poor are commanded by the Lord to contribute 10&nbsp;percent of their income. The power comes from placing our trust in the Lord.\nThe added abundance of the Lord conveyed through your generous tithes has strengthened the reserves of the Church, providing opportunities to advance the Lord\u2019s work beyond anything we have yet experienced. All is known by the Lord, and in time, we will see His sacred purposes fulfilled.\n\n\n\nBlessings Come in Many Ways\n\nThe blessings of tithing come in many ways. In 1998 I accompanied then-Elder Henry&nbsp;B. Eyring to a large Church meeting in the Utah area now known as Silicon Slopes, a community of great innovation in technology. It was a time of growing prosperity, and Elder Eyring cautioned the Saints about comparing what they had with others and wanting more. I will always remember his promise that as they paid an honest tithe, their desire for more material possessions would diminish. Within two years, the technology bubble burst. Many lost their jobs, and companies struggled during this time of financial adjustment. Those who followed the counsel of Elder Eyring were blessed.\nHis promise reminded me of another experience. I met 12-year-old Charlotte Hlimi near Carcassonne, France, in 1990 while serving as a mission president. The Hlimis were a faithful family living in an apartment with eight children. They had a picture of the Savior and of the prophet on the wall. In the interview for her patriarchal blessing, I asked Charlotte if she paid an honest tithe. She responded, \u201cYes, President Andersen. My mother has taught me that there are temporal blessings and spiritual blessings that come from paying our tithing. My mother taught me that if we always pay our tithing, we will want for nothing. And President Andersen, we want for nothing.\u201d\n\nIn giving me permission to share her story, Charlotte, now 45 and sealed in the temple, commented: \u201cMy testimony of tithing was very real at the time, and it is even stronger now. I am deeply grateful for this commandment. As I live it I continue to be abundantly blessed.\u201d\nOne day each of us will finish our earthly journey. Twenty-five years ago, just days before my mother-in-law, Martha Williams, died of cancer, she received a small check in the mail. She immediately asked my wife, Kathy, for her checkbook to pay her tithing. As her mother was so weakened that she could scarcely write, Kathy asked if she could write the check for her. Her mother responded, \u201cNo, Kathy. I want to do it myself.\u201d And then she quietly added, \u201cI want to be right before the Lord.\u201d One of the final things Kathy did for her mother was to hand her tithing envelope to her bishop.\n\n\n\nGod\u2019s Important Work\n\nMy brothers and sisters, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is \u201cout of obscurity,\u201d bringing remarkable blessings across the earth. There will be those who cheer us forward and those who do not. I have thought of the words of the wise Gamaliel, who, upon hearing of the miracles of the Apostles Peter and John, warned the council in Jerusalem:\n\u201cLet [these men] alone: for if \u2026 this work be of men, it will come to nought:\n\u201cBut if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest \u2026 ye be found even to fight against God.\u201d\nYou and I are part of God\u2019s important work upon the earth. It will not come to naught but will continue to move across the world, preparing the way for the Savior\u2019s return. I testify to the words of President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson: \u201cIn coming days, we will see the *greatest* manifestations of the Savior\u2019s power that the world has *ever* seen. Between now and the time He returns&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;, He will bestow countless privileges, blessings, and miracles upon the faithful.\u201d\nThis is my witness. Jesus is the Christ. This is His holy work. He will come again. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Eyring to a large Church meeting in the Utah area now known as Silicon Slopes, a community of great innovation in technology. It was a time of growing prosperity, and Elder Eyring cautioned the Saints about comparing what they had with others and wanting more. I will always remember his promise that as they paid an honest tithe, their desire for more material possessions would diminish. Within two years, the technology bubble burst. Many lost their jobs, and companies struggled during this time of financial adjustment. Those who followed the counsel of Elder Eyring were blessed."

In the interview for her patriarchal blessing, I asked Charlotte if she paid an honest tithe. She responded, \u201cYes, President Andersen. My mother has taught me that there are temporal blessings and spiritual blessings that come from paying our tithing. My mother taught me that if we always pay our tithing, we will want for nothing.

        "full_markdown": "One of the most touching moments in the Book of Mormon is the resurrected Savior\u2019s visit to the people at the temple in the land Bountiful. After a day of teaching, healing, and building faith, Jesus directed the people\u2019s attention to the rising generation: \u201cHe commanded that their little children should be brought.\u201d He prayed for them and blessed them one by one. The experience was so moving that the Savior Himself wept multiple times.\nThen, speaking to the multitude, Jesus said:\n\u201cBehold your little ones.\n\u201cAnd as they looked \u2026 they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven,\u201d ministering to their children.\nI have often thought about this experience. It must have melted every person\u2019s heart! They saw the Savior. They felt Him. They knew Him. He taught them. He blessed them. And He loved them. It\u2019s no wonder that after this sacred event, these children grew up to help establish a society of peace, prosperity, and Christlike love that lasted for generations.\nWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if our children could have experiences like that with Jesus Christ\u2014something that would bind their hearts to Him! He invites us, as He invited those parents in the Book of Mormon, to bring our little ones to Him. We can help them know their Savior and Redeemer the way these children did. We can show them how to find the Savior in the scriptures and build their foundations on Him.\nRecently, a good friend taught me something I hadn\u2019t noticed before about the parable of the wise man who built his house upon a rock. According to the account in Luke, as the wise man laid the foundation for his house, he \u201cdigged deep.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a casual or simple endeavor\u2014it took effort!\nTo build our lives on the rock of our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, we need to dig deep. We remove anything that is sandy or superfluous in our lives. We keep digging until we find Him. And we teach our children to bind themselves to Him through sacred ordinances and covenants so that when the oppositional storms and floods come, as they surely will, they will have little effect upon them \u201cbecause of the rock upon which [they] are built.\u201d\nThis kind of strength doesn\u2019t just happen. It is not passed on to the next generation like a spiritual inheritance. Each person must dig deep to find the rock.\nWe learn this lesson from another account in the Book of Mormon. When King Benjamin gave his final address to his people, they gathered as families to hear his words. King Benjamin bore powerful witness of Jesus Christ, and the people were deeply moved by his testimony. They declared:\n\u201cThe Spirit \u2026 has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will \u2026 all the remainder of our days.\u201d\nOne might expect that little children with such deeply converted parents would eventually become converted and make covenants themselves. And yet, for some reason not mentioned in the record, the covenant made by the parents did not get traction with some of their children. Several years later \u201cthere were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.\n\u201cThey did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd they would not be baptized; neither would they join the church. And they were a separate people as to their faith.\u201d\nWhat a sobering thought! For the rising generation, it\u2019s not enough for faith in Jesus Christ to be \u201cthe tradition of their fathers.\u201d They need to own faith in Christ for themselves. As the covenant people of God, how can we instill within the hearts of our children a desire to make and keep covenants with Him?\nWe can start by following the example of Nephi: \u201cWe talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\u201d Nephi\u2019s words imply a constant, ongoing effort to teach our children about Christ. We can ensure that the voice of the covenant people is not silent in the ears of the rising generation and that Jesus is not a Sunday-only topic.\nThe voice of the covenant people is found in our own words of testimony. It is found in the words of living prophets. And it is preserved powerfully in the scriptures. It is there that our children will come to know Jesus and find answers to their questions. It is there they will learn for themselves the doctrine of Christ. It is there they will find hope. This will prepare them for a lifetime of seeking truth and living on the covenant path.\nI love this counsel from President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson:\n\u201cWhere *can* we go to hear Him?\n\u201cWe can go to the scriptures. They teach us about Jesus Christ and His gospel, the magnitude of His Atonement, and our Father\u2019s great plan of happiness and redemption. Daily immersion in the word of God is crucial for spiritual survival, especially in these days of increasing upheaval. As we feast on the words of Christ daily, the words of Christ will tell us how to respond to difficulties we never thought we would face.\u201d\nSo what does it look like to feast on the words of Christ and hear Him? Well, it looks like whatever works best for you! It might be gathering with your family to talk about the things the Holy Ghost taught you in your scripture study using Come, Follow Me. It might be gathering each day with your children to read a few verses from the scriptures and then looking for opportunities to discuss what you learned as you spend time together. Just find what works for you and your family; then try to do a little better each day.\nConsider this insight from Teaching in the Savior\u2019s Way: \u201cTaken individually, a single home evening, scripture study session, or gospel conversation may not seem like it is accomplishing much. But the accumulation of small, simple efforts, repeated consistently over time, can be more powerful and strengthening than an occasional monumental moment or landmark lesson. \u2026 So don\u2019t give up, and don\u2019t worry about accomplishing something grand every time. Just be consistent in your efforts.\u201d\nOne of our most sacred responsibilities is to help our children come to know deeply and specifically that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, their personal Savior and Redeemer, who stands at the head of His Church! We cannot allow our covenant voice to become muted or silent when it comes to Him.\nYou may feel a bit inadequate in this role, but you should never feel alone. For example, ward councils are authorized to organize teacher council meetings for parents. In these quarterly meetings, parents can gather to learn from each other\u2019s experiences, discuss how they are strengthening their families, and learn key principles of Christlike teaching. This meeting should be held in the second hour of church. It is led by a ward member selected by the bishop and follows the format of regular teacher council meetings, using Teaching in the Savior\u2019s Way as the primary resource. Bishops, if your ward is not currently holding teacher council meetings for parents, work with your Sunday School president and ward council to organize yourselves.\nMy dear friends in Christ, you are doing much better than you think. Just keep working at it. Your children are watching, listening, and learning. As you teach them, you will come to know their true nature as beloved sons and daughters of God. They may forget the Savior for a season, but I promise you He will never forget them! Those moments when the Holy Ghost speaks to them will persist in their hearts and minds. And one day your children will echo the testimony of Enos: I know my parents are just, \u201cfor [they] taught me \u2026 in the nurture and admonition of the Lord\u2014and blessed be the name of my God for it.\u201d\nLet us accept the Savior\u2019s invitation and bring our children to Him. As we do so, they will see Him. They will feel Him. They will know Him. He will teach them. He will bless them. And, oh, how He will love them. And, oh, how I love Him. In His holy name, Jesus Christ, amen.",

We have met people who have gone through the impossible, who have suffered the unthinkable.\n\n\nWe have seen the manifestation of the Savior\u2019s power in a widow who lost her husband while they were on the Lord\u2019s errand in Bolivia. We have seen it in a young woman in Argentina who fell under a train and lost her leg, just because someone wanted to steal her cell phone. And in her single father, who now must pick up the pieces and strengthen his daughter after such an unexplainable act of cruelty. We have seen it in the families that lost their homes and every possession during fires in Chile just two days before Christmas in 2022. We have seen it in those who suffer after a traumatic divorce and in those who are innocent victims of abuse.\n\nWhat gives them the power to go through hard things? What gives an extra layer of strength to go on when everything seems lost?\nI have found that the source of that strength is faith in Jesus Christ as we intentionally seek to come unto Him each and every day.\nThe prophet Jacob taught, \u201cAnd he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.\u201d\nAt times, having faith in Jesus Christ may seem like something impossible, almost unattainable. We may think that coming unto Christ requires a strength, power, and perfection we don\u2019t have, and we just can\u2019t find the energy to do it all. But what I have learned from all these people is that faith in Jesus Christ is what gives us the energy to begin the journey. Sometimes we may think, \u201cI need to fix my life before I come to Jesus,\u201d but the truth is that we come to Jesus to fix our lives through Him.\nWe don\u2019t come to Jesus because we are perfect. We come to Him because we are flawed and in Him we can \u201cbe perfected.\u201d\nHow do we begin exercising a little bit of faith every day? For me it begins in the morning: When I wake up, instead of looking at my phone, I say a prayer. Even a simple prayer. Then I read a scripture. This helps me with my weekly covenant that I make as I partake of the sacrament to \u201calways remember him.\u201d When I begin my day with a prayer and a scripture, I can \u201cremember Him\u201d when I do look at my phone. I can \u201cremember Him\u201d when I face problems and conflicts, and I try to face them like Jesus would.\nWhen I \u201cremember Him,\u201d I feel a desire to change, to repent. I find the source of energy to keep my covenants, and I feel the influence of the Holy Ghost in my life \u201cand keep his commandments which he has given [me]; that [I] may always have his Spirit.\u201d It helps me to endure to the end. Or at least to the end of the day! And in those days that I fail to remember Him all day, He is still there, loving me and telling me, \u201cIt\u2019s OK; you can try again tomorrow.\u201d\nAlthough we are imperfect at remembering Him, our loving Heavenly Father never fails to remember us.\nOne of the mistakes we often make is to think that keeping covenants, or the promises we make to God, is somehow a transaction we make with Him: I obey, and He protects me from anything bad ever happening to me. I pay my tithing, and I will never lose my job or the fire will not burn my house. But then when things don\u2019t go as we expected, we cry unto the Lord, \u201cCarest thou not that *I* perish?\u201d\nOur covenants are not merely transactional; they are transformational. Through my covenants I receive sanctifying, strengthening power of Jesus Christ, which allows me to become a new person, to forgive what seems unforgivable, to overcome the impossible. Intentionally remembering Jesus Christ *always* is powerful; it gives me added strength to \u201ckeep his commandments which he has given [me].\u201d It helps me to be nicer, to smile for no reason, to be a peacemaker, to avoid conflict, to let God prevail in my life.\nWhen our pain or the pain of someone we love is so much that we can\u2019t bear it, remembering Jesus Christ and coming unto Him can lighten the burden, soften the heart, and ease the pain. This is the power that enabled a father beyond his natural capacity to sustain his daughter through the physical and emotional pain of losing her leg.\n\nWhen Elder Soares visited Argentina last June and asked Flavia about her tragic accident, she faithfully replied, \u201cI experienced turmoil, bitterness, anger, and hate when [this happened]. Something that helped me was not to ask, \u2018why me?\u2019 but \u2018what for?\u2019 \u2026 This was something that brought me closer to others and the Lord. \u2026 Instead of distancing myself from Him, I had to cling to Him.\u201d\nPresident Nelson taught: \u201cThe reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power\u2014power that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better. \u2026 Thus, covenant keepers are entitled to a special kind of *rest*.\u201d This is the kind of rest and peace I saw in the eyes of the widow, despite the heartache she felt of missing her husband every day.\n\nThe New Testament tells of a time when Jesus and His disciples were on a ship:\n\u201cAnd there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd he was \u2026 asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?\n\u201cAnd he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?\u201d\nI have always been intrigued by this story. Did the Lord expect them to use their faith to calm the storm? To rebuke the winds? Faith in Jesus Christ is the feeling of peace to withstand the storm, knowing that we will not perish because He is in the ship with us.\nThis is the kind of faith we saw when we visited the families after the fires in Chile. Their houses had been burned to the ground; they had lost everything. Yet as we were walking in what used to be their homes and they were telling us about their experiences, we felt that we were standing on holy ground. One sister said to my wife, \u201cWhen I saw that nearby houses were burning, I had the impression that our house was going to be burned, that we were going to lose everything. Instead of desperation, I experienced a sense of indescribable peace. Somehow, I felt everything was going to be OK.\u201d Trusting God and keeping our covenants with Him bring power to our weakness and comfort to our grief.\nI am grateful for the opportunity that Renee and I had to meet some of these extraordinary Saints, for their many examples of faith, strength, and perseverance. For stories of heartbreak and disappointment that will never make the front page of a newspaper or ever go viral. For the pictures that are not taken of tears shed and prayers offered after a loss or a traumatic divorce; for the posts that are never made of the fear, the sorrow, and the pain that become bearable thanks to faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement. These people strengthen my own faith, and for that I am deeply grateful.\nI know this is the Church of Jesus Christ. I know that He stands ready to endow us with His power if we come to Him each and every day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Introduction\n\nRecently, the eyes of the sporting world focused on the 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, hosted by Australia and New Zealand. World-class athletes narrowed from more than 200 national teams from around the globe demonstrated their grit, dedication, talent, and athleticism as they competed for the soccer world\u2019s highest honor.\nWe marvel at performers in numerous sports and other disciplines who achieve the highest level of their art. We speak of their God-given talents or gifts. This includes those gifted in dance, gymnastics, music, art, drama, mathematics, science, and more. Each such person demonstrates God-given gifts that are then refined and honed by a lifetime of hard work, study, and practice. God-given gifts make gifted people.\n\n\n\nExercising Spiritual Gifts\n\nLooking through a gospel lens, God endows His children with many spiritual gifts, making them spiritually gifted people. Covenant-keeping members of the Church are bestowed with gifts of the Spirit, which include the gift of a testimony of Jesus Christ as our Savior, the gift of the Holy Ghost, the gift of faith to heal and be healed, the gift of discernment, the gift of receiving miracles, and the gifts of wisdom and knowledge. The Lord invites us to earnestly seek the best gifts, even spiritual gifts. He gives spiritual gifts to bless us and to use in blessing others.\nReturning to our analogy of gifted performers, it is important to remember that a gift alone does not a master make. Extraordinary natural talent notwithstanding, it is through painstaking and laborious practice and effort that performers refine and hone their craft to reach their highest level of artistry. Even those gifts received and unwrapped are often accompanied by the dreaded language \u201csome assembly required.\u201d\nLikewise, I have observed a learning curve associated with spiritual gifts. Exercising spiritual gifts requires spiritual exercise. \u201cHaving the guidance of the Holy Ghost in your life requires spiritual work. This work includes fervent prayer and consistent scripture study. It also includes keeping your covenants and God\u2019s commandments. \u2026 It includes worthily partaking of the sacrament each week.\u201d\nWhat are the fruits of exercising spiritual gifts? They include promptings from the Spirit that help us face our daily needs and show us what to do and say and blessings of peace and comfort. As we listen and act on spiritual promptings, the Holy Ghost magnifies our abilities and capacities to far exceed what we can do on our own. These precious spiritual gifts will help us in every aspect of our lives.\nThe constant companionship of the Holy Ghost is one of the greatest spiritual gifts Latter-day Saints enjoy.\nHow important is this gift? President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson answered this question categorically when he stated that \u201cin coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow to Invite and Recognize the Promptings of the Spirit\n\nOver the course of my ministry, I have found a universal longing by everyone to know how to invite and recognize the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Promptings of the Spirit are very personal and come in different ways. We are, however, blessed to have words of prophets, both ancient and modern, give us valuable insights about how to receive direction from the Spirit.\nLet me offer four guiding principles that may be of assistance to you in inviting and recognizing the promptings of the Spirit.\n\n\nStand in Holy Places\n\nThe first is to stand in holy places. I recently participated in the Tokyo Japan Temple open house. The response to formal invitations sent to both media and VIP guests far exceeded expectations. Hundreds joined in these guided temple tours. Guests were deeply touched by the beauty of the temple, including patterns and motifs with deep, traditional Japanese connections. More poignant yet was the reverent and respectful reaction elicited from guests as ancestral ordinances were described in rooms where they would occur. But most heartwarming were stirrings of the Spirit.\nOne such moment with a prominent government official remains etched in my mind. Following a moment of meditative silence in the celestial room, emotional and deeply touched he whispered in my ear, \u201cEven the air that I breathe in this room feels different.\u201d I recognized he was trying to describe the presence of the Holy Spirit, which, indeed, dwells in sacred spaces. If you hope to feel the Spirit, be in a place where the Spirit can easily dwell.\nOur temples and homes are the most sacred of these dedicated spaces. In them we more easily invite and recognize the Spirit. Other holy places include meetinghouses, seminary buildings and institutes, and Church history sites and visitors\u2019 centers. Stand in holy places.\n\n\n\nStand with Holy People\n\nSecond, stand with holy people. I\u2019ll describe the second guiding principle with another memory.\nI will never forget participating in a devotional held in a popular sports arena. Usually, this arena was filled with raucous fans cheering their home team and perhaps even jeering their opponent. But on this night, the atmosphere was quite different. The arena was filled with thousands of young people assembled to honor and commemorate the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Their reverent, quiet tone; gratitude; and prayerful hearts filled the arena with the presence of the Holy Spirit. I could literally see it in their faces. It was the gift of the Holy Ghost in action, affirming the testimonies being borne of Joseph Smith and the Restoration of the gospel.\nThe Spirit cannot be restrained from attending a gathering of holy people. If you hope to feel the Spirit, be with people with whom the Spirit can easily dwell. The Savior said it this way: \u201cFor where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\u201d For young people, consider your gatherings of holy people: quorums and classes, FSY and seminary, ward and stake activities\u2014even ward choirs. Choose to be with people and go to places where righteousness is found. Find your strength in numbers. Find good friends. Be good friends. Support one another wherever you are. Stand with holy people.\n\n\n\nTestify of Holy Truths\n\nThird, testify of holy truths as often as you can. The Comforter always shares His voice when we testify with our voice. The Spirit bears witness to the speaker and listener alike.\nI remember once taking a 45-minute taxi ride in New York City. Having had a warm gospel conversation with the driver for the duration of my ride to the airport, I paid her and prepared to exit the taxi. Then I realized I had not offered a testimony of what I had shared. Pausing, I shared a simple, short testimony, inviting the Spirit and bringing tears to both our eyes.\nAs you seek and take opportunities to share your testimony with others, you will create moments to recognize the Spirit for yourself.\n\n\n\nListen to the Holy Spirit\n\nThe final principle is to listen to the Holy Spirit. He can be our constant companion, but He speaks in subtle, quiet tones. The prophet Elijah found that the voice of the Lord was not in the wind, the earthquake, or the fire but was \u201ca still small voice.\u201d It is \u201cnot a voice of thunder\u201d but rather \u201ca still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper,\u201d and yet it can \u201cpierce even to the very soul.\u201d\nPresident Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer stated: \u201cThe Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all.\u201d I have observed that sometimes His voice is so subtle, or I am so preoccupied, that a loved one captures it for me. Many have been the times when promptings of the Holy Ghost have come to me through my wife, Lesa. Righteous parents or leaders may also receive inspired guidance for you.\nThe noise, clamor, and contention prevalent in the world may overpower still, quiet impressions of the Holy Spirit. Find a quiet place, a holy space where you can seek to receive direction from the Spirit.\n\n\n\n\nSome Words of Caution\n\nAs you consider these principles to invite and recognize the Spirit, consider the following words of cautionary guidance.\n**Confirm your spiritual impressions.** For example, impressions from the Spirit will align with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets.\n**Be certain that the feelings you receive are consistent with your assignment.** Unless you are called by proper authority, impressions from the Spirit are not given for you to counsel or correct others.\n**Spiritual matters cannot be forced.** You can cultivate an attitude and an environment that invite the Spirit, and you can prepare yourself, but you cannot dictate how or when inspiration comes. Be patient and trust that you will receive what you need when the time is right.\n**Use your own best judgment.** Sometimes we want to be led by the Spirit in all things. However, often the Lord wants us to use our God-given intelligence and act in ways that are consistent with our best understanding. President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks taught:\n\u201cA desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our personal choices. \u2026 Persons who try to shift all decision making to the Lord and plead for revelation in every choice will soon find circumstances in which they pray for guidance and don\u2019t receive it.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cWe should study things out in our minds. \u2026 Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it. \u2026 If we do not receive guidance, we should act upon our best judgment.\u201d\n\n\n\nConclusion with an Invitation\n\nIn conclusion, Latter-day Saints should be gifted, covenant-keeping people. Nonetheless, it remains for each of us to seek to exercise our spiritual gifts and then to invite and learn to recognize promptings of the Spirit. Four guiding principles to assist us in this crucial spiritual endeavor are:\n\n\nStand in holy places.\n\n\nStand with holy people.\n\n\nTestify of holy truths.\n\n\nListen to the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nYour ability to invite and recognize the promptings of the Spirit will develop a step at a time. \u201cBecoming more attuned to the language of the Spirit is like learning another language. It is a gradual process that requires diligent, patient effort.\u201d\nReturning to where we began, please remember that as Latter-day Saints you are gifted. Picture this familiar fast Sunday scene, recently described to me. A young child, standing on a stool, was barely visible over the pulpit. Her father stood next to her, offering encouragement and assisting with soft whispers to her ear as she proudly shared, \u201cI am a child of God.\u201d\nThe next testimony that followed came from a young adult who began with a nervous quip: \u201cI wish I had someone whispering in my ear like that.\u201d Then she had a flash of inspiration and testified, \u201cI do have someone whispering in my ear like that\u2014the Holy Ghost!\u201d\nI close with an invitation especially for all youth! Many of you start your day by standing in front of a mirror. Tomorrow, this week, this year, always, pause as you look at yourself in the mirror. Think to yourself, or say aloud if you like, \u201cWow, look at me! I am awesome! I am a child of God! He knows me! He loves me! I am gifted\u2014gifted with the Holy Ghost as my constant companion!\u201d\nI add my testimony to you, gifted Latter-day Saints, of God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, who bears testimony of Them. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Do you want to be happy? What makes you unhappy? President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson said: \u201cIf you want to be miserable, break the commandments\u2014and never repent. If you want joy, stay on the covenant path.\u201d Isn\u2019t it simple to be happy? Just make covenants and keep them in your lives. Let us review some things that can help us to stay on the covenant path and make us happy.\n\n\n1. What Is the Covenant Path?\n\nAccording to Elder Dale&nbsp;G. Renlund, \u201cthe term *covenant path* refers to a series of covenants whereby we come to Christ and connect to Him. Through this covenant bond, we have access to His eternal power. The path begins with faith in Jesus Christ and repentance, followed by baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost.\u201d We renew these covenants every time we partake of the sacrament.\nBeginning with the baptismal covenant, we make more covenants throughout our lives. Again, Elder Renlund said: \u201cThe covenant path leads to the ordinances of the temple, such as the temple endowment. The endowment is God\u2019s gift of sacred covenants that connect us more fully to Him.\u201d\n\n\n\n2. Are You on the Covenant Path?\n\nSometimes when we make covenants, we fail to keep them. When this happens, how can you return to the covenant path? Let me share some examples of returning to the covenant path.\nA little over a month ago, I received a message from a returned missionary who had served with us. He said: \u201cThe last while has been tough. Battling anxiety and depression every day has been weighing me down, and it is very difficult. I feel alone and just miserable. I have been praying for the guidance of our Heavenly Father for peace and comfort in what I can do to battle the hardship. \u2026 While I was praying, I felt the prompting of the Spirit tell me that I needed to be paying my tithing in full. \u2026 I felt the Spirit so strongly, and I immediately felt the urge to do so. With the desire to do so, I felt the prompting that \u2018if you pay your tithing, everything will be OK.\u2019 I am still struggling to find peace, but I do have a testimony in our Savior and that through my obedience, I can feel and find the peace I am looking for in my heart and mind. I have recently decided to come back to the Church and to seek the Spirit in all that I do.\u201d\nNow he is doing very well. You also may ask Heavenly Father for peace, but the answer may be different than what you anticipate it will be. As long as you seek to know of the Savior and pray to Heavenly Father, He will give you a customized answer for you.\nPresident Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson taught:\n\u201cThe greatest lesson we can learn in mortality is that when God speaks and we obey, we will always be right.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we keep the commandments, our lives will be happier, more fulfilling, and less complicated. Our challenges and problems will be easier to bear, and we will receive [God\u2019s] promised blessings.\u201d\nWhen I was called to be a bishop, it was during the most difficult time of my life. I was a young father in my early 30s, but I was in trouble financially because of family challenges. I couldn\u2019t find any solution, and I thought the challenges would never end. I was exhausted financially and emotionally. I started doubting my spiritual strength as well. It was at that difficult time that my stake president extended the calling to me. I accepted the call anyway, although it was hard.\nMy wife also had an interview with the stake president, but she could not say yes, and she did not say no either but kept shedding tears. She cried for the whole week, asking Heavenly Father, \u201cWhy now?\u201d and \u201cDo You really know each individual?\u201d She didn\u2019t get an answer, but I was sustained as bishop on the following Sunday. She did not ask Heavenly Father those questions anymore but supported me in my calling for six years.\nOn the Sunday when I was released, my wife heard a voice while she was receiving the sacrament. The voice whispered to her, \u201cBecause it was too hard for you to walk, I called him as a bishop in order to hold you and walk for you.\u201d Looking back at the past six years, she realized that all of the many challenges that seemed to be endless had now been resolved along the way.\nWe learned that when we think it is not a good time for us to receive a calling, it may be the time we need that calling the most. Whenever the Lord asks us to serve in any calling, whether it is a lighter or heavier calling, He sees our needs. He provides the strength we need and has blessings ready to be poured out upon us as we faithfully serve.\nThere are many other things that distract us from staying on the covenant path. No matter what it is, it is never too late to turn our hearts to Heavenly Father for help. Elder Paul&nbsp;V. Johnson taught us: \u201cWhen we follow Satan, we give him power. When we follow God, He gives us power.\u201d\nKing Benjamin in the Book of Mormon testifies: \u201cI would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.\u201d\n\n\n\n3. How Can Keeping Covenants with God Make You Happy?\n\nMy wife says that our marriage yokes us together, and because of that she can do things she couldn\u2019t do before. For example, ever since she was young, she has had a hard time going out in the dark, but it is not hard anymore because I go with her. She is short and cannot reach to the high shelves unless she uses a chair or ladder, but I can reach the things from high shelves for her because I am taller than her. Taking our Savior\u2019s yoke upon us is like that. As we yoke ourselves to Him, we can do things we couldn\u2019t do on our own because He can do the things we cannot do for ourselves.\nElder David&nbsp;A. Bednar said: \u201cMaking and keeping sacred covenants yokes us to and with the Lord Jesus Christ. In essence, the Savior is beckoning us to rely upon and pull together with Him, even though our best efforts are not equal to and cannot be compared with His. As we trust in and pull our load with Him during the journey of mortality, truly His yoke is easy and His burden is light.\u201d\nPresident Nelson also taught:\n\u201cYoking yourself with the Savior means you have access to *His* strength and redeeming power.\u201d\n\u201cThe reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power\u2014power that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better. This power eases our way. Those who live the higher laws of Jesus Christ have access to His higher power.\u201d\n\u201cKeeping covenants actually makes life easier! Each person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples\u2014and keeps them\u2014has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nMy dear brothers and sisters, do you want to be happy? Stay on the covenant path. Your life will be easier, happier, and filled with joy. Our Savior is inviting us, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d He is the living Christ. He carries our burdens and makes our life easier. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Six years ago our family was traveling at night just outside the city of Oxford. As is often the case with young children, we needed to stop, so we found a service station with an array of shops and restaurants. With precision, we filed out of the car, visited the services, and filed back in, resuming our journey.\nFifteen minutes later our eldest son asked a significant question: \u201cWhere is Jasper?\u201d Jasper sits on his own at the back of the car. We assumed he had fallen asleep or was hiding or playing a trick on us.\nAs his brother inspected the back of the car more closely, we discovered our five-year-old son was not there. Our hearts filled with dread. As we made our way back to the service station, we pleaded with Heavenly Father that Jasper would be kept safe. We called the police and informed them of the situation.\nWhen we anxiously arrived, more than 40 minutes later, we found two police vehicles in the car park, lights flashing. Inside one of them was Jasper, playing with the buttons. I will never forget the joy we felt in being reunited with him.\nMany of the Savior\u2019s parabolic teachings focus on gathering, restoring, or striving to find that which has been scattered or lost. Among these are the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son.\nAs this incident with Jasper has played in my mind over the years, I have reflected on the divine identity and importance of God\u2019s children, the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, and the perfect love of a Father in Heaven, who knows you and me. I hope to bear witness of these truths today.\n\n\nI. Children of God\n\nLife is challenging. Many people feel overwhelmed, alone, isolated, or exhausted. When things are difficult, we may feel that we have wandered or fallen behind. Knowing that we are all children of God and members of His eternal family will restore a sense of belonging and purpose.\nPresident M.&nbsp;Russell Ballard shared: \u201cThere is one important identity we all share now and forever. \u2026 That is that you are and have always been a son or daughter of God. \u2026 Understanding this truth\u2014really understanding it and embracing it\u2014is life-changing.\u201d\nDo not misunderstand or devalue how important you are to your Father in Heaven. You are not an accidental by-product of nature, a cosmic orphan, or the result of matter plus time plus chance. Where there is design, there is a designer.\nYour life has meaning and purpose. The ongoing Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ brings light and understanding regarding your divine identity. You are a beloved child of Heavenly Father. You are the subject matter of all those parables and teachings. God loves you so much that He sent His Son to heal, rescue, and redeem you.\nJesus Christ recognized the divine nature and eternal worth of each person. He explained how the two great commandments to love God and love our neighbor are the foundation of all of God\u2019s commandments. One of our divine responsibilities is to care for those in need. This is why as disciples of Jesus Christ we \u201cbear one another\u2019s burdens, \u2026 mourn with those that mourn \u2026&nbsp;, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort.\u201d\nReligion is not only about our relationship with God; it is also about our relationship with each other. Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland explained that the English word *religion* comes from the Latin *religare*, meaning \u201cto tie\u201d or, more literally, \u201cto re-tie.\u201d Thus, \u201ctrue religion [is] the tie that binds us to God and to each other.\u201d\nHow we treat one another truly matters. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson teaches, \u201cThe Savior\u2019s message is clear: His *true* disciples build, lift, encourage, persuade, and inspire.\u201d This is even more important when our fellow travelers feel lost, alone, forgotten, or removed.\nWe do not have to look far to find people who are struggling. We can start by helping someone in our own family, congregation, or local community. We can also seek to relieve the suffering of the 700 million people living in extreme poverty or the 100 million people who are forcibly displaced due to persecution, conflict, and identity-based violence. Jesus Christ is the perfect example of caring for those in need\u2014the hungry, the stranger, the sick, the poor, the imprisoned. His work is our work.\nElder Gerrit&nbsp;W. Gong teaches that \u201cour journey to God is often found together.\u201d As such, our wards should be a refuge for all of God\u2019s children. Are we passively attending church or actively creating communities whose purpose is to worship, remember Christ, and minister to one another? We can heed President Nelson\u2019s counsel to judge less, love more, and extend the pure love of Jesus Christ through our words and actions.\n\n\n\nII. The Redemptive Power of Jesus Christ\n\nThe Atonement of Jesus Christ is the supreme expression of our Heavenly Father\u2019s love for His children. The word *atonement* describes the setting \u201cat one\u201d of those who have been estranged or separated.\nOur Savior\u2019s mission was to provide both a way to return to Heavenly Father and relief in the journey. The Savior knows through His experience how to support us through life\u2019s challenges. Make no mistake: Christ is our rescuer and the healer of our souls.\nAs we exercise faith, He helps us press forward through hardships. He continues to extend His loving and merciful invitation:\n\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; \u2026 and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d\nThe metaphor of the yoke is powerful. As President Howard&nbsp;W. Hunter explained: \u201cThe yoke was a device \u2026 that allowed the strength of a second animal to be linked and coupled with the effort of a single animal, sharing and reducing the heavy labor of the [task in hand]. A burden that was overwhelming or perhaps impossible for one to bear could be equitably and comfortably borne by two bound together with a common yoke.\u201d\nPresident Nelson taught: \u201cYou come unto Christ to be yoked with Him and with His power, so that you\u2019re not pulling life\u2019s load alone. You\u2019re pulling life\u2019s load yoked with the Savior and Redeemer of the world.\u201d\nHow do we yoke or bind ourselves to the Savior? Elder David A. Bednar explains: \n\u201cMaking and keeping sacred covenants yokes us to and with the Lord Jesus Christ. In essence, the Savior is beckoning us to rely upon and pull together with Him.&nbsp;\u2026 \n\u201cWe are not and never need be alone.\u201d\nTo anyone burdened, lost, confused: You do not have to do this alone. Through the Atonement of Christ and His ordinances, you can be yoked or bound to Him. He will lovingly provide the strength and healing you need to face the journey ahead. He is the refuge from our storms still.\n\n\n\nIII. Heavenly Father\u2019s Love\n\nFor the record, Jasper is witty, affectionate, intelligent, and rambunctious. But the key to this story is he is mine. He is my son, and I love him more than he will ever know. If an imperfect, earthly father feels this way about his child, can you imagine how a perfect, glorified, loving Heavenly Father feels about you?\nTo my dear friends of the rising generation, Gen Z and Gen Alpha: Please know faith requires work. We live in a time when, for many, only \u201cseeing is believing.\u201d Faith can be challenging and requires choices. But prayers are answered. And answers can be felt. Some of the most real things in life are not seen; they are felt, known, and experienced. They too are real.\nJesus Christ wants you to know and have a relationship with your Father in Heaven. He taught, \u201cWhat man among you, having a son, and he shall be standing out, and shall say, Father, open thy house that I may come in and sup with thee, will not say, Come in, my son; for mine is thine, and thine is mine?\u201d Can you think of a more personal, loving image of God the Eternal Father?\nYou are His child. If you are feeling lost, if you have questions or lack wisdom, if you are struggling with your circumstances or wrestling with spiritual dissonance, turn to Him. Pray to Him for comfort, love, answers, and direction. Whatever the need and wherever you are, pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. For some, you may want to follow President Nelson\u2019s invitation and ask \u201cif He is really there\u2014if He knows you. Ask Him how He feels about you. And then listen.\u201d\nDear brothers and sisters:\n\n\nKnow your Father in Heaven. He is perfect and loving.\n\n\nKnow who Jesus Christ is. He is our Savior and Redeemer. Bind yourself and those you love to Him.\n\n\nAnd know who you are. Know your true divine identity. God\u2019s plan of happiness is all about you. You are His precious child and of great worth. He knows and loves you.\n\n\nOf these simple but foundational truths I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "My dear brothers and sisters, my thoughts today are on the gathering of Israel, what President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson calls \u201cthe most important thing taking place on earth today. Nothing else compares in magnitude, nothing else compares in importance, nothing else compares in majesty.\u201d\nThe gathering is the ultimate recognition that \u201cthe worth of souls is great in the sight of God.\u201d It is as simple as that. We are gathering God\u2019s children in these last days that they might have \u201cblessings poured out upon their heads\u201d and the promises of \u201cthe riches of eternity.\u201d It follows that to gather Israel we need missionaries\u2014many more than are serving. Today I am speaking to the many seasoned seniors in the Church who could serve as missionaries. The Lord needs you. We need you in New York and Chicago, Australia and Africa, Thailand and Mexico, and everywhere in between.\nLet me take you back to the year 2015. I was a newly called member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. One of the wonderful responsibilities we carry as Apostles is to assign missionaries to their fields of labor. I had participated as a Seventy in the process, but now as an Apostle, I felt the full weight of the assignment. I began with prayerfully placing a great number of young elders and sisters, one by one, in missions around the world. Then I turned to the senior couples. There were 10 on the list. Not very many. Surprised, I asked my associate from the Missionary Department, \u201cHow many do we need this week to fill the requests?\u201d\nHe responded, \u201c300.\u201d\nThat sobering moment has stayed with me: 10 couples to fill 300 requests.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has encouraged couples to \u201cget on their knees and ask Heavenly Father if the time is right for them to serve a mission.\u201d Of all the qualifications, he said, \u201ca *desire* to serve may be the most important.\u201d\nAs the scripture says, \u201cIf ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.\u201d That work is all about the law of the harvest. We read in John, \u201cBoth he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.\u201d\nI have seen the law of the harvest fulfilled in my own family.\nSome years ago I was visiting family, when the bishop asked me to conclude the sacrament service. As I was coming down from the stand, a woman approached me with her seven children and introduced herself as Sister Rebecca Guzman.\nShe asked, \u201cElder Rasband, do you know Rulon and Verda Rasband?\u201d\nI beamed and replied, \u201cThey are my parents.\u201d\nYou can see where this is going. With Rebecca\u2019s permission, who is here with family in the Conference Center, I share her family\u2019s story.\n\nMy parents, Elder Rulon and Sister Verda Rasband, were serving as a senior couple in the Florida Fort Lauderdale Mission. They were proselyting and by divine guidance knocked on the door of Rebecca\u2019s home. She was just a teenager and loved listening to the music of the Osmonds, in particular our friend Donny\u2014who is here with us today. She had listened to their media interviews and learned they were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She felt there was something different about them, and thinking it might be their religion, Rebecca spent two years researching the Church\u2019s beliefs in the school library. So, when a kindly-looking couple knocked on her family\u2019s door and introduced themselves as Latter-day Saint missionaries, she was taken back.\n\u201cMy mother told me to get rid of them,\u201d Rebecca later wrote, \u201cbut my heart said, \u2018No.\u2019 I looked into their faces, and I felt so much warmth and love. The memory still brings tears to my eyes and deep emotion to my heart.\u201d\nRebecca invited them in, and my missionary parents shared a message with her, her two younger sisters, and, despite her objections, her mother.\nRebecca described to me: \u201cBoth your parents were wonderful in explaining any questions we had. I can still see their faces as if there was light surrounding them. We always hugged your mother when she left, and she always made a point of helping my mother feel comfortable and respected. Your father always had a sparkle in his eyes as he was teaching us about Jesus Christ. He tried to include my father in discussions and eventually won him over. My father was a chef at a local country club and started cooking dinners for your parents, including making your father\u2019s favorite, key lime pie.\u201d\nWhen Elder and Sister Rasband asked Rebecca and her family to read the Book of Mormon, Rebecca did so in five days. She wanted to be baptized immediately, but the other members of her family were not ready. After four months, Rebecca insisted she be baptized and join the true Church. She recalled, \u201cEvery fiber of my soul knew it was true.\u201d On April&nbsp;5, 1979, missionaries baptized 19-year-old Rebecca, her mother, and two sisters. My father was a witness at the baptism.\nWhen I met Rebecca and her family at church, we took a photograph of her family with me. I took it home to my elderly mother, and she held it close to her heart. Then she said to me, \u201cRonnie, this is one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d\n\nMy mother\u2019s response begs the question for our seniors: \u201cWhat are you doing at this stage of your life?\u201d There are so many ways senior missionaries can do what no one else can. You are a remarkable force for good, seasoned in the Church, and poised to encourage and rescue God\u2019s children.\nSome of you might be thinking: \u201cBut what about leaving the grandchildren? We would miss family milestones, birthdays, friends, and even our pets.\u201d If I had asked my mother why she and Dad went on a mission, I know she would have said this: \u201cI have grandchildren. I want them to know that your father and I served in the mission field, we wanted to set an example for our posterity, and we were blessed, so blessed.\u201d\nAs I have visited missions around the world, I have seen the remarkable service of our legion of senior missionaries. It is clear they are happy doing \u201cthe will of the Lord\u201d and being about \u201cthe Lord\u2019s business.\u201d\nFor some, and we hope thousands of you, full-time missionary service in another corner of the world will be just the right place. For others, serving a Church-service mission at home might be preferable. Because of health issues and other circumstances, there are those who are unable to serve. We understand those situations, and it would be my hope you might find ways to support those who are serving. Follow the prophet\u2019s counsel and pray to know what the Lord would have you do.\nMission fields around the world are pleading for your help. President Nelson has said of our senior missionaries, \u201cThey are young in spirit, wise, and willing to work.\u201d\nOut in the field, you have a smorgasbord of opportunities: you may serve in mission offices or temples, strengthen young missionaries, bolster small branches, work in FamilySearch centers or at historic sites, teach institute, provide humanitarian service, work with young adults, help in employment centers or on Church farms. The particulars of ways to serve, what best suits you, where you are needed, and how you can get ready to go are addressed on the website \u201cSenior Missionary.\u201d You can also talk with your bishop or branch president.\nI have called many couples to serve and watched as the Light of Christ has filled their countenances. At their return, they have described growing closer to the Lord and closer to one another, feeling the Spirit of the Lord pour down upon them, and knowing they are making a difference. Who would not want that?\nA mission might be the greatest chapter in a couple\u2019s life. A good title might be \u201cMy Lord Will Have Need of Me.\u201d You may be on unfamiliar ground; however, the power of the Spirit will make you feel right at home.\nMy parents and tens of thousands of returned missionary couples have borne testimony of the joy they found in missionary work. The Lord has said in latter-day scripture, \u201cAnd if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\u201d\nIsaiah gave us a poetic description of what it means to serve in the mission \u201cfield.\u201d Scripture tells us \u201cthe field is the world.\u201d This great ancient prophet wrote, \u201cFor ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.\u201d The mountains, hills, fields, and trees can be likened to mission presidents, bishops, district leaders, members, and those who seek the truth but \u201cthey know not where to find it.\u201d They will testify that the senior missionaries change the very landscape with their testimony of our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ.\nAs an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, I ask you to serve as a missionary in the gathering of Israel and perhaps even serve again. We need you\u2014we need you. We are grateful to you seniors for the lives you have led and the examples you have been in your homes, wards, and stakes. I now invite you to take your know-how, coupled with your time-honored testimonies, and go on a mission. I pray that the next time I sit down to assign senior couples, there will be hundreds of you waiting anxiously for your call.\nI also promise that as you serve, you will feel the love of the Lord in your life, you will know Him, He will know you, and \u201chow great shall be your joy.\u201d Your dedicated service to Jesus Christ will inspire and bless your family, your grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. \u201cPeace, and love [will] be multiplied\u201d in their lives for years to come. I promise. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "While on a business flight several years ago, I found myself seated next to a man from the Netherlands. I was eager to visit with him since I had served in Belgium and the Netherlands as a young missionary.\nAs we became acquainted, he gave me his business card with the unique job title of \u201cprofessor of happiness.\u201d I commented on his amazing profession and asked him what a professor of happiness did. He said he taught people how to have a happy life by establishing meaningful relationships and goals. I replied, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, but what if you could also teach how those relationships can continue beyond the grave and answer other questions of the soul, such as what is the purpose of life, how can we overcome our weaknesses, and where do we go after we die?\u201d He admitted that it would be amazing if we had the answers to those questions, and I was pleased to share with him that we do.\nToday, I would like to review a few essential principles for true happiness that seem to elude so many in this confusing world, where many things are interesting but few are truly important.\nAlma taught the people of his day, \u201cFor behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and *behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all*\u2014for behold, the time is not far distant *that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people*.\u201d\nThis declaration is equally important to us today as we anticipate and prepare for Christ\u2019s Second Coming!\nTherefore, my first observation is that building upon the foundation of Jesus Christ is essential to our happiness. This is a sure foundation, \u201ca foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.\u201d Doing so prepares us for the challenges of life, come what may.\nMany years ago, I went to a summer Scout camp with our son Justin. As the activities got underway, he excitedly announced that he and his friends wanted to earn the archery merit badge. Doing so required the boys to pass a short written test and hit a target with their arrows.\nMy heart sank. At the time, Justin was quite frail due to cystic fibrosis, a disease he had been battling since birth. I wondered if he could pull the bow back far enough to send the arrow to the target.\nAs he and his friends left for the archery class, I silently prayed that he would not be humiliated by the experience. A couple of anxious hours later, I saw him coming up the path toward me with a big smile. \u201cDad!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI got the merit badge! I got a bull\u2019s-eye; it was on the target next to mine, but I hit a bull\u2019s-eye!\u201d He had pulled the bow back with all his might and let the arrow fly, unable to control its trajectory. How grateful I am for that understanding archery instructor who never said, \u201cSorry, wrong target!\u201d Rather, upon seeing Justin\u2019s obvious limitations and earnest effort, he kindly responded, \u201cGood job!\u201d\nThat is how it will be for us if we do our very best to follow Christ and His prophets in spite of our limitations. If we come unto Him by keeping our covenants and repenting of our sins, we will joyfully hear our Savior\u2019s commendation: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant.\u201d\nI bear you my witness of the divinity of the Savior of the world and of His redemptive love and power to heal, strengthen, and lift us when we are earnestly striving to come unto Him. Conversely, there is no way we can move with the crowd and also toward Jesus. The Savior has defeated death, disease, and sin and has provided a way for our ultimate perfection if we will follow Him with all of our hearts.\nMy second observation is that it is crucial to our happiness that we remember that we are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father. Knowing and trusting this reality changes everything.\nSeveral years ago, on a flight home from a Church assignment, Sister Sabin and I found ourselves seated directly behind a very large man who had a big, angry face tattooed on the back of his bald head as well as the number *439*.\nWhen we landed, I said, \u201cExcuse me, sir. Do you mind if I ask the significance of the number tattooed on the back of your head?\u201d I didn\u2019t dare ask about the angry face.\nHe said, \u201cThat\u2019s me. That\u2019s who I am. I own that territory: 219!\u201d\n*Four hundred and thirty-nine* was the actual number on his head, so I was surprised he got it wrong since it was so important to him.\nI thought how sad it was that this man\u2019s identity and self-esteem were based on a number associated with a gang territory. I thought to myself: This tough-looking man was once someone\u2019s little boy who still needed to feel valued and to belong. If only he knew who he really was and to whom he really belonged, for we have all been \u201cbought with a price.\u201d\nThere is a wise line in a song from the film The Prince of Egypt that states, \u201cLook at your life through heaven\u2019s eyes.\u201d As the knowledge of our divine lineage and eternal potential sinks deep into our souls, we will be able to view life as a purposeful, unfolding adventure to learn and grow from, even as \u201cwe see through a glass, darkly,\u201d for a short season.\nThe third hallmark for happiness is to always remember the worth of a soul. We do this best by following the Savior\u2019s admonition: \u201cLove one another; as I have loved you.\u201d\nHe also taught, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d\nThe book of Proverbs wisely counsels, \u201cWithhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.\u201d\nWe will never regret being too kind. In God\u2019s eyes, kindness is synonymous with greatness. Part of being kind is being forgiving and nonjudgmental.\nMany years ago our young family was going to see a movie for family home evening. We were all in the van except for one of our sons and my wife, Valerie. It was dark outside, and as our son threw open the door and ran toward the car, he accidentally kicked what he thought was our cat on the porch. Unfortunately for our son and my wife, who was right behind him, it was not our cat but rather a very unhappy skunk, who let them know it! We all returned to the house, where they both showered and washed their hair with tomato juice, the *supposed* sure remedy to eliminate the skunk odor. By the time they had cleaned up and changed their clothes, we were all desensitized to any odor, so we decided we were OK to go to the movie after all.\u202f\nOnce we were seated at the back of the theater, one by one the people around us suddenly decided to go out to get popcorn. When they came back, however, no one returned to their original seat.\nWe have laughed as we\u2019ve recalled that experience, but what if all of our sins had an odor? What if we could smell dishonesty, lust, envy, or pride? With our own weaknesses revealed, we would hopefully be a little more considerate and careful of others and, likewise, they with us as we make the needed changes in our lives. I actually love the smell of tobacco in church because it indicates someone is trying to change. They need our welcoming arms around them.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has wisely said, \u201cOne of the easiest ways to identify a *true follower* of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people.\u201d\nPaul wrote to the Ephesians, \u201cAnd be ye\u202fkind\u202fone to another, tenderhearted, forgiving\u202fone another, even as God for Christ\u2019s sake hath forgiven you.\u201d\nAs disciples of Jesus Christ, we are asked to trust Heavenly Father and our Savior and not attempt to replace Them. Jesus Christ knows everyone\u2019s imperfections perfectly and will judge them perfectly.\nMy fourth happiness hallmark is to maintain an eternal perspective. Our Father\u2019s plan stretches into the eternities; it is easy to focus on the here and now and forget the hereafter.\nI was taught this lesson powerfully a number of years ago by our then-16-year-old daughter, Jennifer. She was about to have a double lung transplant, where the five diseased lobes of her lungs would be completely removed and replaced by two healthy smaller lobes, donated by two amazing Christlike friends. It was a very high-risk procedure, yet the night before her surgery, Jennifer almost preached to me with all of her 90&nbsp;pounds (41&nbsp;kg), saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad! Tomorrow I will wake up with new lungs, or I will wake up in a better place. Either way will be great.\u201d That is faith; that is eternal perspective! Seeing life from an eternal vantage point provides clarity, comfort, courage, and hope.\nAfter the surgery, when the long-awaited day came to remove the breathing tube and turn off the ventilator that had been helping Jennifer breathe, we anxiously waited to see if her two smaller lobes would work. When she took her first breath, she immediately started crying. Seeing our concern, she quickly exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s just so good to breathe.\u201d\u202f\nEver since that day, I have thanked Heavenly Father morning and night for my ability to breathe. We are surrounded by innumerable blessings that we can easily take for granted if we are not mindful. Conversely, when nothing is expected and everything is appreciated, life becomes magical.\nPresident Nelson has said: \u201cEach new morning is a gift from God. Even the air we breathe is a loving loan from Him. He preserves us from day to day and supports us from one moment to another. Therefore, our first noble deed of the morning should be a humble prayer of gratitude.\u201d\nThat brings me to my fifth and final observation, which is you will never be happier than you are grateful.\nThe Lord declared, \u201cAnd he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious.\u201d Perhaps this is because gratitude gives birth to a multitude of other virtues.\nHow our awareness would change if every morning we awoke with only the blessings we were grateful for the night before. Failure to appreciate our blessings can result in a sense of dissatisfaction, which can rob us of the joy and happiness that gratitude engenders. Those in the great and spacious building entice us to look beyond the mark, thereby missing the mark entirely.\nIn reality, the greatest happiness and blessing of mortality will be found in who we have become through God\u2019s grace as we make and keep sacred covenants with Him. Our Savior will polish and refine us through the merits of His atoning sacrifice and has said of those who willingly follow Him, \u201cThey shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels.\u201d\nI promise you that if we build our lives upon the foundation of Jesus Christ; value our true identity as sons and daughters of God; remember the worth of a soul; maintain an eternal perspective; and gratefully appreciate our many blessings, especially Christ\u2019s invitation to come unto Him, we can find the true happiness we seek during this mortal adventure. Life will still have its challenges, but we will be able to better face each with a sense of purpose and peace because of the eternal truths we understand and live by.\nI bear you my witness of the reality of God, our loving Father, and of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. I also testify of living prophets, seers, and revelators. What a blessing it is to receive the counsel of heaven through them. As the Savior clearly stated, \u201cWhether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.\u201d In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

We all returned to the house, where they both showered and washed their hair with tomato juice, the *supposed* sure remedy to eliminate the skunk odor. By the time they had cleaned up and changed their clothes, we were all desensitized to any odor, so we decided we were OK to go to the movie after all."

        "full_markdown": "In the [[Alma 5|fifth chapter of Alma]], an introspective question is posed: \u201cCould ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble?\u201d That question implies that humility is a mandatory requirement for us to be ready to return to the presence of God.\nWe all like to think we are sufficiently humble, but some experiences in life make us realize that the natural, prideful man or woman often is very much alive within us.\nYears ago, when our two daughters were still living at home, I decided to show them and my wife the business unit of which I was in charge in the company I worked for.\nMy real purpose though was to show them a place where, unlike our home, everyone would do exactly what I asked them to do without questioning me. As we arrived at the front gate, which usually opened automatically when my car approached, I was surprised that it didn\u2019t open this time. Instead, a security guard I had never seen before in my life came to the car and asked me for my company ID.\nI told him I never needed an ID to drive into the property with my car and then asked him the classic prideful-person question: \u201cDo you know who you\u2019re talking to?\u201d\nTo which he replied, \u201cWell, since you don\u2019t have your company ID, I cannot know who you are, and while I am at this gate, you will not be allowed to enter the premises without proper identification.\u201d\nI thought about looking at the rearview mirror to check my daughters\u2019 reaction to all that, but I knew they were savoring every second of that moment! My wife at my side was shaking her head in disapproval of my behavior. My last resort then was to apologize to the guard and say I was very sorry for treating him so badly. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven,\u201d he said, \u201cbut without a company ID, you\u2019re not coming in today!\u201d\nI then drove very slowly back home to get my ID, having perhaps learned this valuable lesson: when we choose not to be humble, we end up being humiliated.\nIn Proverbs we find, \u201cA man\u2019s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.\u201d In order to develop humility, we must understand what it really means in the context of the gospel.\n\nSome people confuse being humble with other things such as, for example, being poor. But there are actually many who are poor and prideful and also many who are rich and yet humble. Others who are very shy or have low self-esteem may have an outward appearance of humility but deep inside are full of pride sometimes.\nThen what is humility? According to Preach My Gospel, it is a \u201cwillingness to submit to the will of the Lord. \u2026 It is being teachable. \u2026 [It] is a vital catalyst for spiritual growth.\u201d\nThere are certainly many opportunities for us all to improve in this Christlike attribute. I would like to explore first how humble we\u2019ve been, or should be, in following the counsel of our prophet. A pop quiz for us individually could be:\n\n\nDo we mention the full name of the Church in all our interactions? President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson said, \u201cTo remove the Lord\u2019s name from the Lord\u2019s Church is a major victory for Satan.\u201d\n\n\nAre we letting God prevail in our lives by accepting our prophet\u2019s very specific invitation? \u201cToday I call upon our members everywhere to lead out in abandoning attitudes and actions of prejudice.\u201d\n\n\nAre we overcoming the world, trusting the doctrine of Christ more than the philosophies of men, as our prophet taught?\n\n\nHave we become peacemakers, saying positive things to and about people? President Nelson taught us last general conference the following: \u201cIf there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy that we can say about another person\u2014whether to his face or behind her back\u2014that should be *our* standard of communication.\u201d\n\n\nThese are simple but powerful instructions. Remember, all the people of Moses had to do to be healed was to look at the brass serpent which he had lifted up. But \u201cbecause of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished.\u201d\nDuring this conference we\u2019ve heard and will yet hear the unfailing counsel of our prophets and apostles. It\u2019s a perfect occasion to develop humility and let our strong opinions be swallowed by an even stronger conviction that the Lord does speak through these chosen leaders.\nAbove all, in developing humility, we must also understand and accept that we are not able to overcome our challenges or to achieve our full potential through our own efforts only. Motivational speakers, writers, coaches, and influencers around the world, especially on digital platforms, will say that everything depends solely on us and our actions. The world believes in the arm of flesh.\nBut through the restored gospel, we\u2019ve learned that we greatly depend on Heavenly Father\u2019s benevolence and the Atonement of our Savior, Jesus Christ, \u201cfor we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to make and keep covenants with God, as doing so will give us full access to the healing, enabling, and perfecting power of Jesus Christ through His Atonement.\nAttending sacrament meeting weekly and worshipping in the temple regularly to participate in the ordinances and to receive and renew covenants is a sign that we recognize our dependence on Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ. That will invite Their power into our lives to help us through all our problems and ultimately fulfill the measure of our creation.\nNot long ago the level of my humility and understanding of my dependence on the Lord was once again tested. I was in a taxi going to the airport to catch a short flight to a place where there was a very difficult situation to solve. The taxi driver, who was not a member of the Church, looked at me through the mirror and said, \u201cI can see you\u2019re not well today!\u201d\n\u201cCould you tell?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. Then he said something like, \u201cYou actually have a very negative halo around you!\u201d\nI explained to him that I had quite a hard situation to deal with, and he then asked me, \u201cHave you done everything in your power to solve this?\u201d\nI responded I had done everything I could.\nHe then said something I have never forgotten: \u201cSo leave this in God\u2019s hands, and everything will work out fine.\u201d\nI confess that I was tempted to ask him, \u201cDo you know who you\u2019re talking to?\u201d But I didn\u2019t! What I did was humble myself before the Lord throughout that one-hour flight, asking for divine help. As I left the airplane, I learned that the difficult situation to be solved was already in order and that my presence wouldn\u2019t even be necessary anymore.\nBrothers and sisters, the command, invitation, and promise from the Lord is clear and comforting: \u201cBe thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.\u201d\nMay we be humble to follow the counsel of our prophets and accept that only God and Jesus Christ can transform us\u2014through ordinances and covenants received in His Church\u2014into the best version of ourselves in this life and, one day, make us perfect in Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "When our youngest daughter, Berkeley, was little, I started using reading glasses\u2015the kind that zoom in and magnify everything. One day, as we sat together reading a book, I looked at her with love but also sadness because, suddenly, she seemed more grown up. I thought, \u201cWhere has the time gone? She\u2019s so big!\u201d\nAs I lifted my reading glasses to wipe away a tear, I realized, \u201cOh wait\u2014she\u2019s not bigger; it\u2019s just these glasses! Never mind!\u201d\nSometimes all we can see is that up-close, magnified view of those we love. Tonight, I invite you to zoom out and look through a different lens\u2014an eternal lens that focuses on the big picture, your bigger story.\nDuring humankind\u2019s early push into space, the unmanned rockets had no windows. But by the *Apollo 8* mission to the moon, the astronauts had one. While floating in space, they were struck by the power of seeing our earth and took this spectacular image, capturing the whole world\u2019s attention! Those astronauts experienced a sensation so powerful it has been given its own name: the overview effect.\n\n\n\nNASA\n\n\nViewing from a new vantage point changes *everything*. One space traveler said it \u201creduces things to a size that you think everything is manageable. \u2026 We can do this. Peace on earth\u2014no problem. It gives people that type of energy \u2026 that type of power.\u201d\nAs humans, we have an earthbound point of view, but God sees the grand overview of the universe. He sees all creation, all of us, and is filled with hope.\nIs it possible to begin to see as God sees even while living on the surface of this planet\u2014to feel this *overview* feeling? I believe we can, through the eye of faith, zoom out and view ourselves and our families with hope and joy.\nThe scriptures agree. Moroni speaks about those whose faith was so \u201cexceedingly strong\u201d that they \u201ctruly saw \u2026 with an eye of faith, *and they were glad*.\u201d\nWith an eye focused on the Savior, they felt joy and knew this truth: because of Christ, it all works out. Everything *you* and *you* and *you* are worried about\u2014it\u2019s all going to be OK! And those who look with an eye of faith can *feel* that it\u2019s going to be OK *now*.\nI went through a rough patch my senior year in high school when I wasn\u2019t making great choices. I remember seeing my mom crying, and I wondered if I\u2019d disappointed her. At the time, I worried that her tears meant she\u2019d lost hope for me, and if she didn\u2019t feel hope for me, maybe there wasn\u2019t a way back.\nBut my dad was more practiced at zooming out and taking the long view. He\u2019d learned from experience that worry feels a lot like love, but it\u2019s not the same. He used the eye of faith to see that everything would work out, and his hopeful approach changed me.\nWhen I graduated from high school and went to BYU, my dad sent letters reminding me of who I was. He became my cheerleader, and everybody needs a cheerleader\u2014someone who isn\u2019t telling you, \u201cYou\u2019re not running fast enough\u201d; they\u2019re lovingly reminding you that you can.\nDad exemplified Lehi\u2019s dream. Like Lehi, he knew that you don\u2019t chase after your loved ones who feel lost. \u201cYou stay where you are and call them. You go to the tree, stay at the tree, keep eating the fruit and, with a smile on your face, continue to beckon to those you love and show by example that eating the fruit is a happy thing!\u201d\nThis visual image has helped me during low moments when I find myself at the tree, eating the fruit and crying because I\u2019m worried; and really, how helpful is that? Instead, let\u2019s choose hope\u2014hope in our Creator and in one another, fueling our ability to be better than we are right now.\nShortly after Elder Neal&nbsp;A. Maxwell passed away, a reporter asked his son what he\u2019d miss most. He said dinners at his parents\u2019 house because he always left feeling like his dad believed in him.\nThis was around the time our adult children were starting to come home for Sunday dinners with their spouses. During the week, I found myself making lists in my mind of things I could remind them of on Sunday, like \u201cMaybe try and help out more with the kids when you\u2019re home\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t forget to be a good listener.\u201d\nWhen I read Brother Maxwell\u2019s comment, I threw away the lists and silenced that critical voice, so when I saw my grown children for that brief time each week, I focused on the many positive things they were already doing. When our oldest son, Ryan, passed away a few years later, I remember being grateful our time together was happier and more positive.\nBefore we interact with a loved one, can we ask ourselves the question \u201cIs what I\u2019m about to do or say helpful or hurtful?\u201d Our words are one of our superpowers, and family members are like human blackboards, standing in front of us saying, \u201cWrite what you think of me!\u201d These messages, whether intentional or unintentional, should be hopeful and encouraging.\nOur job is not to teach someone who\u2019s going through a rough patch that they are bad or disappointing. On rare occasions we may feel prompted to correct, but most often let\u2019s tell our loved ones in spoken and unspoken ways the messages they long to hear: \u201cOur family feels whole and complete because you are in it.\u201d \u201cYou will be loved for the rest of your life\u2014no matter what.\u201d\nSometimes what we need is empathy more than advice; listening more than a lecture; someone who hears and wonders, \u201cHow would I have to feel to say what they just said?\u201d\nRemember, families are a God-given laboratory where we\u2019re figuring things out, so missteps and miscalculations are not just possible but probable. And wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if, at the end of our lives, we could see that those relationships, even those challenging moments, were the very things that helped us to become more like our Savior? Each difficult interaction is an opportunity to learn how to love at a deeper level\u2014a godlike level.\nLet\u2019s zoom out to view family relationships as a powerful vehicle to teach us the lessons we came here to learn as we turn to the Savior.\nLet\u2019s admit, in a fallen world there\u2019s no way to be a perfect spouse, parent, son or daughter, grandchild, mentor, or friend\u2014but a million ways to be a good one. Let\u2019s stay at the tree, partake of the love of God, and share it. By lifting the people around us, we ascend together.\nUnfortunately, the memory of eating the fruit is not enough; we need to partake again and again in ways that reposition our lens and connect us to the heavenly overview by opening up the scriptures, which are filled with light, to chase away the darkness, staying on our knees until our casual prayer turns mighty. This is when hearts soften, and we begin to see as God sees.\nIn these last days, perhaps our greatest work will be with our loved ones\u2014good people living in a wicked world. *Our* hope changes the way they see themselves and who they really are. And through this lens of love, they\u2019ll see who they *will* become.\nBut the adversary does not want us or our loved ones to return home together. And *because* we live on a planet that is bound by time and a finite number of years, he tries to perpetuate a very real sense of panic in us. It\u2019s hard to see, when we\u2019re zoomed in, that our direction matters more than our speed.\nRemember, \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d Thankfully, the God we worship is *not* bound by time. He sees who our loved ones really are and who *we *really are. So He\u2019s patient with us, hoping we\u2019ll be patient with each other.\nI will admit there are times when earth, our temporal home, feels like an island of sorrow\u2014moments when I have one eye of faith and the other eye is weeping. Do you know this feeling?\nI had it Tuesday.\nCan we instead choose the faithful posture of our prophet when he promises miracles in our families? If we do, our joy will increase even if turbulence increases. He\u2019s promising that an overview effect can be experienced *now*, regardless of our circumstances.\nHaving this eye of faith *now* is a recapturing, or an echo, of the faith we had before we came to this planet. It sees past the uncertainty of a moment, allowing us to \u201ccheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then \u2026 stand still.\u201d\nIs there something difficult in your life right now, something you\u2019re worried can\u2019t be resolved? Without the eye of faith, that might feel like God has lost oversight of things, and is that true?\nOr maybe your greater fear is that you\u2019re going to go through this difficult time all by yourself, but that would mean God has abandoned you, and is that true?\nIt is my witness that the Savior has the ability, because of His Atonement, to turn any nightmare you are going through into a blessing. He has given us a promise \u201cwith an immutable covenant\u201d that as we strive to love and follow Him, \u201c*all things* wherewith [we] have been afflicted shall work together for [our] good.\u201d *All* things.\n\nAnd because we are children of the covenant, we can ask for this hopeful feeling *now*!\nWhile our families aren\u2019t perfect, we can *perfect* our love for others until it becomes a constant, unchanging, no-matter-what kind of love\u2014the type of love that supports change and allows for growth and return.\nIt\u2019s the Savior\u2019s work to bring our loved ones back. It\u2019s *His* work and *His* timing. It is *our* work to provide the hope and a heart they can come home to. \u201cWe have neither [God\u2019s] authority to condemn nor His power to redeem, but we have been authorized to exercise His love.\u201d President Nelson has also taught that others need our love more than our judgment. \u201cThey need to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in [our] words and actions.\u201d\nLove is the thing that changes hearts. It is the purest motive of all, and others can feel it. Let\u2019s hold fast to these prophetic words offered 50 years ago: \u201cNo home is a failure unless it quits trying.\u201d Surely, those who love the most and the longest win!\nIn earthly families, we\u2019re simply doing what God has done with us\u2014pointing the way and hoping our loved ones will go in that direction, knowing the path they travel is theirs to choose.\nAnd when they pass to the other side of the veil and draw close to that loving \u201cgravitational pull\u201d of their heavenly home, I believe it will feel familiar because of how they were loved here.\nLet\u2019s use that *overview lens* and see the people we love and live with as shared companions on this beautiful planet.\nYou and I? We can do this! We can hold on and hope on! We can stay at the tree and partake of the fruit with a smile on our face, letting the Light of Christ in our eyes become something others can count on in their darkest hours. As they see light manifest in our countenances, they will be drawn to it. We can then help refocus their attention to the original source of love and light, \u201cthe bright and morning star,\u201d Jesus Christ.\nI bear my testimony that this\u2014all of this\u2014is going to turn out so much better than we could ever imagine! With an eye of faith on Jesus Christ, may we see that everything will be all right in the end and feel that it will be all right *now*. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "My dear friends, we have had marvelous conference sessions today. We have all felt the Spirit of the Lord and His love through the wonderful messages shared by our leaders. I feel privileged to address you this evening as the concluding speaker of this session. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord continues with us as we rejoice together as true brothers and sisters in Christ.\nOur dear prophet, Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, declared: \u201cI call upon our members everywhere to lead out in abandoning attitudes and actions of prejudice. I plead with you to promote respect for all of God\u2019s children.\u201d As a global and ever-growing Church, following this invitation from our prophet is a vital prerequisite for building the Savior\u2019s kingdom in every nation of the world.\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ teaches that we are all begotten spirit sons and daughters of heavenly parents who truly love us and that we lived as a family in God\u2019s presence before we were born on this earth. The gospel also teaches that we were all created in the image and likeness of God. Therefore, we are equal before Him, for He \u201chath made of one blood all nations of men [and women].\u201d Therefore, we all have divine nature, heritage, and potential, for there is \u201cone God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in [us] all.\u201d\nAs disciples of Christ, we are invited to increase our faith in, and love for, our spiritual brother- and sisterhood by genuinely knitting our hearts together in unity and love, regardless of our differences, thereby increasing our ability to promote respect for the dignity of all the sons and daughters of God.\nWasn\u2019t that exactly the condition that the people of Nephi experienced for almost two centuries after Christ ministered to them?\n\u201cAnd surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. \u2026\n\u201cNeither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.\n\u201cAnd how blessed were they!\u201d\nPresident Nelson further emphasized the importance of spreading dignity and respect for our fellow beings when he stated: \u201cThe Creator of us all calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God\u2019s children. Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent! \u2026 It behooves each of us to do whatever we can in our spheres of influence to preserve the dignity and respect every son and daughter of God deserves.\u201d In reality, human dignity presupposes respect for our differences.\nConsidering the sacred bond that unifies us with God as His children, this prophetic direction given by President Nelson is undoubtedly a fundamental step toward building bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of prejudice and segregation among us. However, as Paul warned the Ephesians, we must recognize that in order to achieve this purpose, it will be required to make an individual and collective effort to act with lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering toward one another.\nThere is a tale of a certain Jewish rabbi who was enjoying the sunrise with two friends. He asked them, \u201cHow do you know when the night is over and a new day has begun?\u201d\nOne of them replied, \u201cWhen you can look into the east and can distinguish a sheep from a goat.\u201d\nThe other then responded, \u201cWhen you can look into the horizon and distinguish an olive tree from a fig tree.\u201d\nThey then turned to the wise rabbi and asked him the same question. After long reflection, he replied, \u201cWhen you can look into the east and see the face of a woman or the face of a man and can say, \u2018She is my sister; he is my brother.\u2019\u201d\nMy dear friends, I can assure you that the light of a new day shines brighter in our lives when we see and treat our fellow beings with respect and dignity and as true brothers and sisters in Christ.\nDuring His earthly ministry, Jesus so perfectly exemplified this principle as He \u201cwent about doing good\u201d unto all people, inviting them to come unto Him and partake of His goodness regardless of their origin, social class, or cultural characteristics. He ministered, healed, and was always attentive to everyone\u2019s needs, especially those who at the time were considered different, belittled, or excluded. He denied *none* but treated them with equity and love, for He saw them as His brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of the same Father.\nOne of the most striking occasions when this occurred was when the Savior traveled to Galilee, purposely taking the route which passed through Samaria. Jesus then decided to sit by Jacob\u2019s well to rest. While there, a Samaritan woman approached to fill her pitcher with water. In His omniscience, Jesus addressed her, saying, \u201cGive me to drink.\u201d\nThis woman was amazed that a Jew had asked a Samaritan woman for assistance and expressed her surprise, saying, \u201cHow is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.\u201d\nBut Jesus, abandoning the long-held traditions of animosity between Samaritans and Jews, lovingly ministered to this woman, helping her to understand who He truly was\u2014that is, the Messiah, who would tell all things and whose coming she was awaiting. The impact of that tender ministry caused the woman to run into the city to announce to the people what had happened, saying, \u201cIs not this the Christ?\u201d\nI have deep compassion for those who have been mistreated, belittled, or persecuted by unfeeling and thoughtless people, because, in the course of my life, I have seen firsthand the pain good people suffer from being judged or dismissed because they happened to speak, look, or live differently. I also feel genuine sorrow in my heart for those whose minds remain darkened, whose vision is limited, and whose hearts remain hardened by the belief in the inferiority of those who are different from them. Their limited view of others actually obstructs their ability to see who they are as children of God.\nAs foretold by the prophets, we are living in the perilous days leading up to the Second Coming of the Savior. The world in general is polarized by strong divisions, accentuated by racial, political, and socioeconomic lines. Such divisions sometimes end up influencing people\u2019s way of thinking and acting in relation to their fellow beings. For this reason, it is not uncommon to see people characterizing the way of thinking, acting, and speaking of other cultures, races, and ethnicities as inferior, making use of preconceived, mistaken, and often sarcastic ideas, generating attitudes of contempt, indifference, disrespect, and even prejudice against them. Such attitudes have their roots in pride, arrogance, envy, and jealousy, characteristics of a carnal nature, which are totally contrary to Christlike attributes. This conduct is improper for those who are striving to become His true disciples. In fact, my dear brothers and sisters, there is no place for prejudiced thoughts or actions in the community of Saints.\nAs sons and daughters of the covenant, we can help to eliminate this kind of behavior by looking at the apparent differences that exist between us with the Savior\u2019s eyes and based on what we have in common\u2014our divine identity and kinship. Moreover, we can strive to see ourselves reflected in the dreams, hopes, sorrows, and pains of our neighbor. We are all fellow travelers as God\u2019s children, equal in our imperfect state and in our ability to grow. We are invited to walk together, peaceably, with our hearts filled with love toward God and all men\u2014or, as Abraham Lincoln noted, \u201cwith malice toward none; with charity for all.\u201d\nHave you ever pondered on how the principle of respect for human dignity and equality is demonstrated through the simple way we dress in the house of the Lord? We all come to the temple united in one purpose and filled with the desire to be pure and holy in His holy presence. Dressed in white, all of us are received by the Lord Himself as His beloved children, men and women of God, progeny of Christ. We are privileged to perform the same ordinances, make the same covenants, commit ourselves to live higher and holier lives, and receive the same eternal promises. United in purpose, we see one another with new eyes, and in our oneness, we celebrate our differences as divine children of God.\nI recently helped guide dignitaries and government officials through the open house for the Bras\u00edlia Brazil Temple. I paused in the changing area with the vice president of Brazil, and we discussed the white clothing that everyone wears inside the temple. I explained to him that this universal use of white clothing symbolizes that we are all alike unto God and that, in the temple, our identities were not vice president of a country or a church leader but our eternal identity as sons of a loving Heavenly Father.\n\nThe Igua\u00e7\u00fa River flows through southern Brazil and empties into a plateau that forms a system of waterfalls known worldwide as the Igua\u00e7\u00fa Falls\u2014one of the most beautiful and impressive of God\u2019s creations on earth, considered one of the seven wonders of the world. A colossal volume of water flows into a single river and then separates, forming hundreds of unparalleled waterfalls. Metaphorically speaking, this phenomenal system of waterfalls is a reflection of God\u2019s family on earth, for we share the same spiritual origin and substance, derived from our divine heritage and kinship. However, each of us flows in different cultures, ethnicities, and nationalities, with different opinions, experiences, and feelings. Despite this, we move forward as God\u2019s children and as brothers and sisters in Christ, without losing our divine connection, which makes us a unique people and a beloved community.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, may we align our hearts and minds with the knowledge and testimony that we are all equal before God, that we are all fully endowed with the same eternal potential and inheritance. May we enjoy more the spiritual kinship that exists between us and value the different attributes and varied gifts we all have. If we do so, I promise you that we will flow in our own way, as does the water of the Igua\u00e7\u00fa Falls, without losing our divine connection that identifies us as a peculiar people, \u201cthe children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.\u201d\nI testify to you that as we continue to flow this way during our mortal life, a new day will begin with a new light that will brighten our lives and illuminate wonderful opportunities to value more, and be more fully blessed by, the diversity created by God among His children. We will surely become instruments in His hands to promote respect and dignity among all His sons and daughters. God lives. Jesus is the Savior of the world. President Nelson is the prophet of God in our day. I bear witness of these truths in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

The world in general is polarized by strong divisions, accentuated by racial, political, and socioeconomic lines. Such divisions sometimes end up influencing people\u2019s way of thinking and acting in relation to their fellow beings. For this reason, it is not uncommon to see people characterizing the way of thinking, acting, and speaking of other cultures, races, and ethnicities as inferior, making use of preconceived, mistaken, and often sarcastic ideas, generating attitudes of contempt, indifference, disrespect, and even prejudice against them. Such attitudes have their roots in pride, arrogance, envy, and jealousy, characteristics of a carnal nature, which are totally contrary to Christlike attributes. This conduct is improper for those who are striving to become His true disciples. In fact, my dear brothers and sisters, there is no place for prejudiced thoughts or actions in the community of Saints."

I went and saw the eye doctor, and I said, \u201cI can\u2019t see the teleprompter.\u201d\nAnd she said, \u201cWell, your eyes are old. They\u2019re not going to change.\u201d\nSo, I\u2019ll do the best I can.\nI\u2019d like to share with you some things that have been in my mind. I have seemed to have the Prophet Joseph in my mind the last few months. I\u2019ve sat and contemplated his glorious responsibility in becoming the prophet of this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.\nI think how grateful we are as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that Joseph Smith, a boy who desired to know what he needed to do to have his sins forgiven, found the courage to go into a grove of trees near his home in Palmyra, New York, and there kneel in prayer and\u2014by his own statement\u2014pray out loud for the first time (see [[Joseph Smith\u2014History 1|Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:14]]).\nOn that occasion, as Joseph got on his knees in what we call the Sacred Grove, the heavens opened. Two personages, brighter than the noonday sun, appeared before him. One spoke to him and said, \u201c[Joseph,] this is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d ([[Joseph Smith\u2014History 1|Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:17]]). Thus began the Restoration of the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ.\nBecause Jesus, our Savior and our Redeemer, spoke to the boy Joseph and opened up this dispensation of time that we now live in, we sing, \u201cPraise to the man who communed with Jehovah!\u201d (\u201cPraise to the Man,\u201d Hymns, no. 27). We thank the Lord for Joseph Smith and for his courage to go into that grove of trees in 1820, near his home in Palmyra, New York.\nI\u2019ve been thinking about all of the marvelous things that we know and all of the things that we have. My beloved brothers and sisters, my testimony to you this morning is how abundantly blessed we are to know all that we know because we have Joseph Smith, the prophet of this last dispensation of time.\nWe have an understanding of the purpose of life, of who we are.\nWe know who God is; we know who the Savior is because we have Joseph, who went into a grove of trees as a boy, seeking forgiveness for his sins.\nI think it\u2019s one of the most glorious and wonderful things that anybody in this world can know\u2014that our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ have revealed Themselves in this latter day and that Joseph has been raised up to restore the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWe have the Book of Mormon. What a marvelous and wonderful gift the Book of Mormon is to the membership of the Church. It is another witness, another testament that Jesus is the Christ. We have it because Joseph was worthy to go get the plates, was inspired by heaven to translate them by the gift and power of God and to give the book to the world.\nThough my message this morning is simple, it\u2019s deep, and it\u2019s full of love for the Prophet Joseph Smith and for all of those, my brothers and sisters, who have sustained him and were willing to sustain him in his youth.\nI would like to pay tribute this morning to his mother. I\u2019ve always thought how wonderful it was that when Joseph came home from that experience in the Sacred Grove and told his mother what had happened, Lucy Mack Smith believed him.\nI\u2019m grateful for his father and his brothers and his sisters and his family, who sustained him in this tremendous responsibility that the Lord placed upon him to become the prophet to restore the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ once again upon the earth.\nSo my testimony this morning is that I know that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the world. I also know that our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ appeared and spoke to Joseph and prepared him to become the prophet.\nI marvel, and I\u2019m sure that many of you do too, at how blessed we are to know what we know about our purpose in life, why we are here, what we should be trying to do and accomplish in our daily lives. We\u2019re in the process of trying to prepare ourselves, a day at a time, to be a little better, be a little kinder, be a little more prepared for that day, which will surely come, when we shall pass back into the presence of our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nThat\u2019s getting a little closer for me. I\u2019ll soon be 95. My children tell me they think I\u2019m a lot older than that some days, but that\u2019s OK. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\nBut for nearly 50&nbsp;years, brothers and sisters, I\u2019ve had the privilege to cover the world in my assignment as a General Authority of the Church. It\u2019s been a wonderful blessing. I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty close to almost all parts of the world. I\u2019ve met with members of the Church all over the world.\nOh, how I love you. What a glorious experience that\u2019s been\u2014to look into your faces, be in your presence, and feel your love that you have for the Lord and for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nMay our Heavenly Father watch over us now and bless all the proceedings of the conference. And may we have the Spirit of the Lord well up in our hearts, and may our love for the gospel of Jesus Christ\u2014our beloved Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014increase as we strive to serve Him and keep His commandments and be more like Him as a result of our attending general conference. Wherever you are in this world, may God bless you. May the Spirit of the Lord be with us. May we feel the power of heaven as we worship together in this session of conference.\nI leave you my witness and testimony that I know that Jesus is the Christ. He is our Savior, our Redeemer. He is our best friend. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "I was introduced to a trail in Israel by my good friend Ilan. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Jesus Trail,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the path from Nazareth to Capernaum that many believe Jesus walked.\u201d I decided right then and there I wanted to walk that trail, so I began planning a trip to Israel.\nSix weeks before the trip, I broke my ankle. My husband worried about the injury; my greatest concern was how I would walk the Jesus Trail one month later. I am stubborn by nature, so I didn\u2019t cancel the plane tickets.\nI remember meeting our Israeli guide that beautiful June morning. I hopped out of the van and then pulled out a set of crutches and a knee scooter. Mya, our guide, took one look at my cast and said, \u201cUh, I don\u2019t think you can walk this trail in that condition.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing that prevents me from trying.\u201d She gave a slight nod, and we began. I love her for that, for believing I could walk the trail broken.\nI navigated the steep path and the boulders for a time on my own. Then, moved by the sincerity of my commitment, Mya pulled out a thin rope, tied it to the handlebars of my scooter, and began to pull. She pulled me up the hills, through lemon orchards, and along the banks of the Sea of Galilee. At the journey\u2019s end, I expressed gratitude for my sweet guide, who had helped me accomplish something I could have never accomplished on my own.\nWhen the Lord called Enoch to journey through the land and testify of Him, Enoch hesitated. He was just a lad, slow of speech. How could he walk that path in his condition? He was blinded by what was broken in him. The Lord\u2019s answer to what hindered him was simple and immediate: \u201cWalk with me.\u201d Like Enoch, we must remember that the One who was bruised and broken for us will allow mortality to do its work in us, but He doesn\u2019t ask us to face those challenges alone. No matter the heaviness of our story or the current course of our path, He will invite us to walk with Him.\nThink of the young man in a spot of trouble who met the Lord in a wilderness place. Jacob had journeyed far from home. In the dark of night, he had a dream that not only contained a ladder but also held significant covenant promises, including what I like to call the five-finger promise. On that night, the Lord stood beside Jacob, introduced Himself as the God of Jacob\u2019s father, and then promised:\n\n\nI am with you.\n\n\nI will keep you safe.\n\n\nI will bring you home again.\n\n\nI will not leave you.\n\n\nI will keep my promise to you.\n\n\nJacob had a choice to make. He could choose to live his life simply acquainted with the God of his father, or he could choose to live life in committed covenant relationship with Him. Years later, Jacob testified of a life lived within the Lord\u2019s covenant promises: \u201cGod \u2026 answered me in the day of my distress, and *was with me* in the way which I went.\u201d Just as He did for Jacob, the Lord will answer each of us in our day of distress if we choose to tether our life with His. He has promised to walk *with us* in the way.\nWe call this walking the covenant path\u2014a path that begins with the covenant of baptism and leads to deeper covenants we make in the temple. Perhaps you hear those words and think of checkboxes. Maybe all you see is a path of requirements. A closer look reveals something more compelling. A covenant is not only about a contract, although that is important. It\u2019s about a relationship. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught, \u201cThe covenant path is all about our relationship with God.\u201d\nConsider a marriage covenant. The wedding date is important, but equally important is the relationship forged through the life lived together afterward. The same is true with a covenant relationship with God. Conditions have been set, and there will be expectations along the way. And yet He invites each of us to come as we are able, with full purpose of heart, and to \u201cpress forward\u201d with Him at our side, trusting that His promised blessings will come. Scripture reminds us that often those blessings come in His own time and in His own way: 38 years, 12 years, immediately. As your trail will demand, so His succor will be.\nHis is a mission of condescension. Jesus Christ will meet us where we are as we are. This is the *why* of the garden, the cross, and the tomb. The Savior was sent to help us overcome. But staying where we are won\u2019t bring the deliverance we seek. Just as He didn\u2019t leave Jacob there in the dirt, the Lord doesn\u2019t intend to leave any of us where we are.\nHis is also a mission of ascension. He will work within us to lift us up to where He is and, in the process, enable us to become as He is. Jesus Christ came to lift us. He wants to help us become. This is the *why* of the temple.\nWe must remember: it\u2019s not the course alone that will exalt us; it\u2019s the companion\u2014our Savior. And *this* is the why of covenant relationship.\nWhen I was in Israel, I visited the Western Wall. For the Jews, this is the most holy site in Israel. It is all that remains of their temple. Most wear their finest when they visit this sacred place; their choice of garment is a symbol of their devotion to their relationship with God. They visit the wall to read scripture, to worship, and to pour out their prayers. The plea for a temple in their midst consumes their every day, their every prayer, this longing for a house of covenant. I admire their devotion.\nWhen I returned home from Israel, I listened more closely to the conversations around me regarding covenants. I noticed people asking, *Why should I walk a covenant path? Do I need to enter a house for making covenants? Why do I wear the holy garment?* *Should I invest in a covenant relationship with the Lord?* The answer to these good and important questions is simple: it depends on what degree of relationship you want to experience with Jesus Christ. Each of us will have to discover our own response to those deeply personal questions.\nHere is mine: I walk this path as a \u201c*beloved* daughter of heavenly parents,\u201d divinely *known* and deeply *trusted*. As a child of the covenant, I am eligible to receive *promised* blessings. I have *chosen* to walk with the Lord. I have been *called* to stand as a witness of Christ. When the path feels overwhelming, I am *strengthened* with enabling grace. Each time I cross the threshold of His house, I experience deeper covenant relationship with Him. I am *sanctified* with His Spirit, *endowed* with His power, and *set apart* to build His kingdom. Through a process of daily repentance and weekly partaking of the sacrament, I am learning to become *steadfast* and to go about doing *good*. I walk this path with Jesus Christ, looking forward to the promised day when He will come again. Then I will be *sealed His* and lifted up as a *holy* daughter of God.\nThis is why I walk the covenant path.\nThis is why I cling to covenant promises.\nThis is why I enter His covenant house.\nThis is why I wear the holy garment as a constant reminder.\nBecause I want to live in committed covenant relationship with Him.\nPerhaps you do too. Begin where you are. Don\u2019t let your condition hinder you. Remember, pace or placement on the path are not as important as progress. Ask someone you trust who is on the covenant path to introduce you to the Savior they have come to know. Learn more of Him. Invest in the relationship by entering into covenant with Him. It doesn\u2019t matter your age or your condition. You can walk with Him.\nAfter we finished walking the Jesus Trail, Mya did not take back her rope. She left it tied to my scooter. For the next few days, my teenage nephews and their friend took turns pulling me through the streets of Jerusalem. They made sure I did not miss out on the stories of Jesus. I was reminded of the strength of the rising generation. We can learn from you. You have a genuine desire to know the guide, Jesus Christ. You trust the strength of the rope that tethers us to Him. You are unusually gifted in gathering others to Him.\nThankfully, we walk this path together, calling out encouragement along the way. As we share our personal experience with Christ, we will strengthen personal devotion. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "At baptism one of the promises that we make is that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ. My purpose today is to remind us that we can show God that we take the name of His Son upon ourselves by bearing testimony in word and deed, as often as we can, that Jesus is the Christ.\nWhen ministering to and teaching the people in the Americas after His Resurrection, the Savior declared:\n\u201cHave they not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the last day;\n\u201cAnd whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day.\u201d\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught us that \u201ctaking the Savior\u2019s name upon us includes declaring and witnessing to others\u2014through our actions and our words\u2014that Jesus is the Christ.\u201d\nAs members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have the blessing and privilege to stand as witnesses of the Lord and His name everywhere we are. As we strive to live our lives in harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ, our conduct will be a living testimony of our Redeemer and His name. Moreover, we witness of Christ in word by sharing with others what we believe, feel, or know of Jesus Christ.\nWhen we humbly share our testimony of the Lord through our words and actions, the Holy Ghost confirms to those with real intent, open hearts, and willing minds that Jesus is indeed the Christ.\nI would like to share two recent and inspiring examples of members who show God that they take the name of Jesus Christ upon themselves by talking of Him and bearing pure witness of the Lord in Church meetings.\nFirst example: When my wife, Elaine, and I went to Spain in 2022, we attended Sunday meetings in a small unit of the Church there. As I sat on the stand and my wife in the congregation, I noticed that she sat by an older woman. When the sacrament meeting ended, I walked toward Elaine and asked her to introduce me to her new friend. She did so and indicated that this woman, who was not a member of the Church, had been visiting the Church for about two years. When I heard that, I asked this God-fearing woman what made her come back and attend our meetings for such an extended period. The woman lovingly replied, \u201cI like to come here because you speak of Jesus Christ in your meetings.\u201d\nClearly, members of the Church in that unit in Spain talked, taught, and testified of Christ in their meetings.\nSecond example: After serving in the Brazil Area, I received a new assignment to serve at Church headquarters. When we moved to Salt Lake City at the end of July of this year, we attended Sunday meetings at our new and wonderful ward. One of these meetings was a fast and testimony meeting. After reverently partaking of the sacrament, members stood up and bore heartfelt testimonies of the Savior one after the other. The meeting was centered on Jesus Christ, and we could palpably feel the Spirit. We were edified, and our faith was strengthened. If friends of the Church, honestly seeking the truth, had been at that meeting, they would have recognized that this is the Church of Jesus Christ.\nWhat a blessing to see that our Church meetings are choice opportunities for us to testify of Christ and signal to God that we rejoice in taking His Son\u2019s name upon us.\nNow, let me mention a powerful example of taking upon us the name of Jesus Christ by bearing testimony of Him through actions.\nLast August, I accompanied Elder Jonathan&nbsp;S. Schmitt to the open house of the Feather River California Temple in Yuba City. There I had the blessing of guiding groups on a tour of the temple. One of these groups included a member of the Church, Virgil Atkinson, and seven friends of other faiths. Toward the end of the visit, in a temple sealing room, Brother Atkinson was emotional as he expressed his love for his friends who had come to the temple that day. Almost immediately after he had done so, a woman in the group stood up and said, \u201cWe all love Virgil. He has never imposed his faith on us. But he is not shy about it either. He just lives what he believes.\u201d\nOver the years, Brother Atkinson\u2019s Christlike living served as a powerful testimony to his friends. His example is strong evidence that he has taken upon himself the name of Christ.\nIn conclusion, let me share the lesson I learned about how to take upon us the name of Christ and testify of Him by using the correct name of the Church.\nPresident Nelson, God\u2019s living prophet, in a 2018 general conference address titled \u201cThe Correct Name of the Church,\u201d said: \u201cIt *is* a correction. It *is* the command of the Lord. Joseph Smith did not name the Church restored through him; neither did Mormon. It was the Savior Himself who said, \u2018For thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 [[[D&C 115|Doctrine and Covenants 115:4]]].\u201d\nWe all left general conference that day committed and determined to follow the prophet and to use the revealed name of the Church from then on. I really watched myself to make sure I used the correct name of the Church. The first few times, I had to be very conscious and not allow myself to go back to the old ways. After the first attempts, I felt more comfortable with using the revealed name of the Church. I admit that many times, I would speak the name of the Church quickly. I felt concerned that people would not pay attention to the Church\u2019s full name and that they might think it to be a bit long.\nHowever, I later realized that speaking the full name of the Church with intent gave me valuable opportunities to speak the name of Jesus Christ and in fact bear testimony of the Savior by declaring His name in the name of His Church. I also noticed that when I spoke the correct name of the Church with others, I more frequently remembered Jesus Christ and felt His influence in my life.\nBy following the prophet, we can all learn to testify more of Jesus Christ by using the correct name of the Church, thus taking upon us more fully the name of the Lord.\nThis Sabbath morning, I gladly testify that President Nelson is God\u2019s living prophet and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is Christ\u2019s restored Church. I humbly witness of the Son of God and His divinity. He is God\u2019s Firstborn and Only Begotten Son, our Savior and Redeemer, the Emmanuel. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "We live in a time when \u201cpeaceable followers of Christ\u201d experience unique challenges. Those who believe in, humbly worship, and testify of Jesus Christ have always experienced trials, tribulation, and adversities. My wife, Mary, and I are no different. In the last few years, we have seen many of our close high school friends, missionary companions, some of their precious wives, and former work associates pass away, or, as President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has said, graduate to the other side of the veil. We have seen some who were raised in faith and belief step off the covenant path.\nSadly, we lost a grandson of 23 who died in a tragic single-car accident. Some dear friends, family members, and colleagues have also endured significant health challenges.\nWhenever trials occur, we mourn and strive to bear one another\u2019s burdens. We lament things that will not be accomplished and songs that will not be sung. Bad things happen to good people on this mortal journey. The devastating fires on Maui in Hawaii, southern Chile, and Canada are examples of horrendous events good people sometimes face.\nWe read in the Pearl of Great Price that the Lord revealed to Abraham the eternal nature of spirits. Abraham learned of our pre-earth life, foreordination, the Creation, the choosing of a Redeemer, and this mortal life, which is the second estate of man. The Redeemer declared:\n\u201cWe will make an earth whereon these may dwell;\n\u201cAnd we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.\u201d\nNow all of us are here in the second estate of our journey of progression toward a kingdom of glory as part of God\u2019s great plan of salvation and exaltation. We are blessed with agency and subject to the trials of mortality. This is the time allotted for us to prepare to meet God. We are blessed to know of Jesus Christ and His role in the plan. We have the privilege to become members of His restored Church\u2014The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As peaceable followers of Christ, we strive to live His commandments. It has never been easy for His followers. Nor was it easy for the Savior to faithfully fulfill His mortal mission.\nThe scriptures are clear: many will succumb to an \u201ceat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die\u201d approach. Other nonbelievers retreat to somber enclaves of like-minded participants who advocate for the next \u201cnew thing\u201d and philosophies of men. They know not where to find the truth.\nPeaceable followers of Christ do not follow either path. We are warm, engaged members of the communities where we live. We love, share, and invite all of God\u2019s children to follow Christ\u2019s teachings. We follow the counsel of our beloved prophet, President Nelson: we choose the role of \u201ca peacemaker, now and always.\u201d This inspired approach is consistent with both the scriptures and prophetic direction.\nIn 1829 the restored Church had not yet been organized, nor had the Book of Mormon been published. A small group of struggling people, moved by the Spirit of God, followed the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Lord revealed to Joseph counsel for difficult times: \u201cFear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.\u201d He also counseled them:\n\u201cLook unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;Be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.\u201d\nClearly, our heavenly destiny is not altered when we suffer adversity. In Hebrews we are counseled to \u201ccome boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\u201d Jesus Christ is \u201cthe author of eternal salvation.\u201d\nI love the words of Mormon, quoted by his son Moroni, commending \u201cthe peaceable followers of Christ \u2026 because of your peaceable walk with the children of men.\u201d\nFor those of us in the Church striving to be peaceable followers of Christ, a brighter day awaits us as we focus on our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Trials are a part of mortality and occur in everyone\u2019s life throughout the world. This includes major conflicts between countries and individuals.\n\nChurch leaders are frequently asked, \u201cWhy does a just God allow bad things to happen, especially to good people?\u201d and \u201cWhy are those who are righteous and in the Lord\u2019s service not immune from such tragedies?\u201d\nWe do not know all the answers; however, we do know important principles that allow us to face trials, tribulation, and adversities with faith and confidence in a bright future that awaits each of us. No better example exists in scripture with respect to passing through tribulation than the word of the Lord to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, while he was a prisoner in Liberty Jail.\nThe Lord in part declared:\n\u201cIf the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.\n\u201cThe Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;Fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.\u201d\nIt is clear we have a Father in Heaven who knows and loves us personally and understands our suffering perfectly. His Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson and President M.&nbsp;Russell Ballard have both strongly emphasized the significance of the new second edition of Preach My Gospel. I share their enthusiasm. This new edition, amplifying sacred scripture, powerfully proclaims:\n\u201cIn His atoning sacrifice, Jesus Christ took upon Himself our pains, afflictions, and infirmities. Because of this, He knows \u2018according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities\u2019 ([[Alma 7|Alma 7:12]]; see also [[Alma 7|verse 11]]). He invites, \u2018Come unto me,\u2019 and as we do, He gives us rest, hope, strength, perspective, and healing ([[Matthew 11|Matthew 11:28]]; see also [[Matthew 11|verses 29\u201330]]).\n\u201cAs we rely on Jesus Christ and His Atonement, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nWe can joyfully be peaceable followers of Christ.\nOur Father\u2019s plan of happiness for His children includes not only a premortal and mortal life but also a potential for eternal life, including a great and glorious reunion with those we have lost. All wrongs will be righted, and we will see with perfect clarity and faultless perspective and understanding.\nChurch leaders have compared this perspective with someone walking into the middle of a three-act play. Those without knowledge of the Father\u2019s plan do not understand what happened in the first act (or the premortal existence) and the purposes established there; nor do they understand the clarification and resolution that come in the third act, which is the glorious fulfillment of the Father\u2019s plan.\nMany do not appreciate that under His loving and comprehensive plan, those who appear to be disadvantaged, through no fault of their own, are not ultimately impacted.\nThe scriptures are clear: peaceable followers of Christ who are righteous, follow the Savior, and keep His commandments will be blessed. One of the most important scriptures for those who are righteous, regardless of their situation in life, is part of King Benjamin\u2019s address to his people. He promises that those who faithfully keep the commandments are blessed in all things in this life and \u201care received into heaven \u2026 [and] dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.\u201d\nWe recognize that almost all of us have experienced physical and spiritual storms in our lives, some devastating. A loving Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, who is the head of His restored Church, have provided us scriptures and prophets to prepare us, warn us about dangers, and give us guidance to prepare and protect us. Some directions require immediate action, and some provide protection for many years in the future. The Lord\u2019s preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, [[D&C 1|section 1]], admonishes us to \u201cgive heed to the words of the prophets.\u201d\n[[D&C 1|Section 1]] also cautions us, \u201cPrepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come.\u201d The Lord provides His people a chance to prepare for the challenges they will face.\nThe Lord gave a powerful revelation to President Brigham Young on January&nbsp;14, 1847, at Winter Quarters. This revelation is a classic example of the Lord preparing people for that which is to come. The faithful Saints had begun their exodus to the mountain sanctuary of the Salt Lake Valley. They had successfully built the Nauvoo Temple and received sacred saving ordinances. They had been driven out of Missouri, and their persecutors had driven them out of Nauvoo in a terrible winter season. The revelation to Brigham gave practical counsel on how to prepare for the exodus. The Lord placed special emphasis on taking care of the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the families of those serving in the Mormon Battalion as the main body of Saints proceeded on their perilous journey.\nIn addition to providing other advice to live righteously, the Lord emphasized two principles that continue to be applicable today.\nFirst, He encouraged them to \u201cpraise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing, and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving.\u201d\nSecond, the Lord counseled if they were \u201csorrowful, call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful.\u201d\nThese two admonitions are great counsel for our own day. Lives full of praise, music, and thanksgiving are uniquely blessed. Being joyful and relying on heavenly help through prayer is a powerful way to be peaceable followers of Christ. Striving always to be of good cheer helps avoid being cast down in spirit.\nThe final line of a perceptive hymn conveys the ultimate answer in a beautiful fashion: \u201cEarth has no sorrow that heav\u2019n cannot heal.\u201d\nAs an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, I testify that \u201cpeaceable followers of Christ\u201d will find personal peace in this life and a glorious heavenly reunion. I bear a sure witness of the Savior\u2019s divinity and the reality of His Atonement. He is our Savior and Redeemer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "A Certain Man Had Two Sons\n\nIt has been called by some the greatest short story ever told. Since it has been translated into thousands of languages across the world, it is quite possible that during the past two millennia, the sun has not set without the story being referenced somewhere in the world.\nIt was told by Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, who came to earth \u201cto save that which was lost.\u201d He begins with these simple words: \u201cA certain man had two sons.\u201d\nImmediately we learn of a heartbreaking conflict. One son tells his father he is through with life at home. He wants his freedom. He wants to leave behind the culture and teachings of his parents. He asks for his share of the inheritance\u2014now.\nCan you imagine what the father felt when he heard this? When he realized that what his son wanted more than anything else was to leave the family and perhaps never return?\n\n\n\nThe Great Adventure\n\nThe son must have felt a thrill of adventure and excitement. At long last, he was on his own. Free from the principles and rules of the culture of his youth, he could finally make his own choices without being influenced by his parents. No more guilt. He could bask in the acceptance of a like-minded community and live life on his own terms.\nArriving in a faraway country, he quickly made new friends and began living the life he had always dreamed of. He must have been a favorite of many, for he spent money freely. His new friends\u2014beneficiaries of his prodigality\u2014did not judge him. They celebrated, applauded, and championed his choices.\nHad there been social media in that time, surely he would have filled pages with animated photos of laughing friends: #Livingmybestlife! #Neverhappier! #Shouldhavedonethislongago!\n\n\n\nThe Famine\n\nBut the party did not last\u2014it rarely does. Two things happened: first, he ran out of money, and second, a famine swept through the land.\nAs the problems worsened, he panicked. The once unstoppable, jubilant high roller now could not afford a single meal, let alone a place to stay. How would he survive?\nHe had been generous to his friends\u2014would they help him now? I can see him asking for a little support\u2014just for now\u2014until he got back on his feet.\nThe scriptures tell us, \u201cNo man gave unto him.\u201d\nDesperate to remain alive, he found a local farmer who hired him to feed swine.\nExtremely hungry now, abandoned and alone, the young man must have wondered how things could have gone so terribly, dreadfully wrong.\nIt wasn\u2019t just an empty stomach that troubled him. It was an empty soul. He had been so sure that giving in to his worldly desires would make him happy, that moral laws were obstacles to that happiness. Now he knew better. And oh, what a price he had to pay for that knowledge!\nAs the physical and spiritual hunger grew, his thoughts returned to his father. Would he help him after all that had happened? Even the humblest of his father\u2019s servants had food to eat and shelter from the storms.\nBut return to his father?\nNever.\nConfess to his village that he had squandered his inheritance?\nImpossible.\nFace the neighbors who surely had warned him that he was disgracing his family and breaking his parents\u2019 hearts? Return to his old friends after boasting of how he was breaking free?\nUnbearable.\nBut the hunger, loneliness, and remorse simply wouldn\u2019t go away\u2014until \u201che came to himself.\u201d\nHe knew what he needed to do.\n\n\n\nThe Return\n\nNow let us go back to the father, the brokenhearted master of the house. How many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours had he spent worrying about his son?\nHow many times had he looked down the very road his son had taken and relived the penetrating loss he had felt as his son walked away? How many prayers had he offered in the deep of night, pleading with God that his son would be safe, that he would discover truth, that he would return?\nAnd then one day, the father looks out on that lonely road\u2014*the road that leads home*\u2014and sees a distant figure walking toward him.\nIs it possible?\nThough the individual is a great way off, the father knows in an instant it is his son.\nHe runs to him, throws his arms around him, and kisses him.\n\u201cFather,\u201d the son cries out, in words he must have rehearsed a thousand times, \u201cI have sinned against both heaven and you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. All I ask is that you take me in as a hired servant.\u201d\nBut the father scarcely lets him finish. Tears in his eyes, he commands his servants: \u201cBring the finest robe in the house and place it on my son\u2019s shoulders. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Make a feast to celebrate. My son has returned!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Celebration\n\nIn my office hangs a painting by the German artist Richard Burde. Harriet and I love this painting. It depicts one tender scene from the Savior\u2019s parable in a deeper perspective.\n\n\nWhile almost everyone is overjoyed at the son\u2019s return, one is not\u2014his older brother.\nHe is carrying some emotional baggage.\nHe was there when his brother demanded his inheritance. He witnessed firsthand the massive weight of grief on his father.\nEver since his brother left, he has tried to lift his father\u2019s burden. Every day, he has worked to restore his father\u2019s broken heart.\nAnd now the reckless child is back, and people can\u2019t stop lavishing attention on his rebellious brother.\n\u201cAll these years,\u201d he tells his father, \u201cnever once have I refused to do a single thing you asked. Yet in all that time, you never celebrated me.\u201d\nThe loving father responds, \u201cDear son, all that I have is yours! This is not about comparing rewards or celebrations. This is about healing. This is the moment we have been hoping for all these years. Your brother was dead and is alive again! He was lost but now he is found!\u201d\n\n\n\nA Parable for Our Time\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, dear friends, like all of the Savior\u2019s parables, this one is not just about people living long ago. It\u2019s about you and me, today.\nWho among us has not departed from the path of holiness, foolishly thinking we could find more happiness going our own self-centered way?\nWho among us has not felt humbled, brokenhearted, and desperate for forgiveness and mercy?\nPerhaps some may even have wondered, \u201cIs it even possible to go back? Will I be labeled forever, rejected, and avoided by my former friends? Is it better to just stay lost? How will God react if I try to return?\u201d\nThis parable gives us the answer.\nOur Heavenly Father will run to us, His heart overflowing with love and compassion. He will embrace us; place a robe around our shoulders, a ring on our finger, and sandals on our feet; and proclaim, \u201cToday we celebrate! For my child, who once was dead, has come back to life!\u201d\nHeaven will rejoice at our return.\n\n\n\nJoy Unspeakable and Full of Glory\n\nMay I take a moment now and speak to you individually?\nNo matter what may have happened in your life, I echo and proclaim the words of my beloved friend and fellow Apostle Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland: \u201cIt is not possible for you to sink lower than the infinite light of Christ\u2019s [atoning sacrifice] shines.\u201d\nThough choices may have taken you far away from the Savior and His Church, the Master Healer stands at the road that leads home, welcoming you. And we as members of the Church of Jesus Christ seek to follow His example and embrace you as our brothers and sisters, as our friends. We rejoice and celebrate with you.\nYour return will not diminish the blessings of others. For the Father\u2019s bounty is infinite, and what is given to one does not in the slightest diminish the birthright of others.\nI do not pretend that coming back is an easy thing to do. I can testify of that. It may, in fact, be the toughest choice you will ever make.\nBut I bear witness that the moment you decide to return and walk in the way of our Savior and Redeemer, His power will enter your life and transform it.\nAngels in heaven will rejoice.\nAnd so will we, your family in Christ. After all, we know what it\u2019s like to be a prodigal. We all rely daily on the same atoning power of Christ. We know this path, and we will walk with you.\nNo, our path will not be free from grief, sorrow, or sadness. But we came this far \u201cby the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.\u201d And together we will \u201cpress forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all [people].\u201d Together we will \u201crejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,\u201d for Jesus Christ is our strength!\nIt is my prayer that each one of us may hear, in this profound parable, the Father\u2019s voice calling us to enter the road that leads home\u2014that we may have the courage to repent, receive forgiveness, and follow the path that leads back to our compassionate and merciful God. Of this I bear witness and leave you my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

The very next day, not far from where we meet today, President Young stood before the Saints and declared: \u201cMany of our brethren and sisters are on the plains with hand-carts, and they must be brought here. \u2026 Go and bring in those people now on the plains.\u201d\nJust two days later, the first rescue parties departed in search of the handcart pioneers.\nA member of the Willie company described the desperate situation prior to the arrival of the main rescue team. He shared: \u201c[Just] when it seemed all would be lost, \u2026 and there seemed little left to live for, like a thunderbolt out of the clear sky, God answered our prayers. A rescue party, bringing food and supplies&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;, came into sight. \u2026 How we thanked God for our rescue.\u201d\nThese rescuers were heroes to the pioneers, putting their own lives at risk in extreme weather conditions to bring as many as possible safely home. One such hero was Ephraim Hanks.\nIn mid-October, and unaware of the handcart predicament, Hanks was returning to his home in Salt Lake following a trip when, during the night, he was awakened by a voice saying, \u201cThe hand-cart people are in trouble and you are wanted; will you go and help them?\u201d\nWith that question ringing in his mind, he hurried back to Salt Lake City. And upon hearing President Heber&nbsp;C. Kimball call for additional volunteers, Hanks set out the very next day, on his own, to the rescue. Moving quickly, he overtook other rescuers en route, and upon reaching the Martin company, Hanks recalled, \u201cThe sight that met my gaze as I entered their camp can never be erased from my memory \u2026 [and] was enough to touch the stoutest heart.\u201d\nEphraim Hanks spent days moving from tent to tent blessing the sick. He related that \u201cin scores of instances, when we administered to the sick, and rebuked the diseases in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the sufferers would rally at once; they were healed almost instantly.\u201d Ephraim Hanks will forever be a hero to those handcart pioneers.\nSimilar to that remarkable rescue, events which impact our lives and even the course of history are frequently the result of decisions and achievements of individual men and women\u2014great artists, scientists, business leaders, and politicians. These extraordinary individuals are often honored as heroes, with monuments and memorials built to commemorate their exploits.\nWhen I was a young boy, my first heroes were athletes. My earliest memories are of collecting baseball cards with the pictures and statistics of Major League Baseball players. \u201cHero worship\u201d as a child can be fun and innocent, as when children dress up as their favorite superheroes for Halloween. Although we admire and respect many talented and remarkable men and women for their abilities and contributions, the degree to which they are revered, if taken to an excess, can be the equivalent of the children of Israel worshipping a golden calf in the desert of Sinai.\nAs adults, what was once innocent childhood fun can become a stumbling block when \u201chero worship\u201d of politicians, bloggers, influencers, athletes, or musicians causes us to look \u201cbeyond the mark\u201d and lose sight of what is truly essential.\nFor the children of Israel, the challenge was not the gold that they brought with them on their journey to the promised land but rather what they allowed the gold to become: an idol, which then became the object of their worship, turning their attention away from Jehovah, who had parted the Red Sea and delivered them from bondage. Their focus on the calf impacted their ability to worship the true God.\n*The* hero\u2014our hero, now and always\u2014is Jesus Christ, and anything or anyone that distracts us from His teachings, as found in the scriptures and through the words of living prophets, can negatively impact our progress on the covenant path. Before the Creation of this world, we looked to Jesus Christ when it became clear that the plan proposed by Father in Heaven, which included our opportunity to progress and become like Him, was being challenged.\nNot only was Jesus Christ the leader in defending our Father\u2019s plan, but He would also play the most crucial role in its implementation. He responded to the Father and volunteered to offer Himself \u201ca ransom for all,\u201d to pay a debt that each of us would incur through sin but could not pay on our own.\nPresident Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks has taught, \u201c[Jesus Christ] has done everything that is essential for our journey through mortality toward the destiny outlined in the plan of our Heavenly Father.\u201d\nIn the Garden of Gethsemane, when faced with such an overwhelming task, the Savior bravely stated, \u201cNot my will, but thine, be done,\u201d and proceeded to take upon Himself the combined pains, the sicknesses, and the suffering for the sins of all who would ever live. In a perfect act of obedience and commitment, Jesus Christ completed *the* supreme heroic act in all of creation, culminating in His glorious Resurrection.\nIn our most recent general conference, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson reminded us: \u201cWhatever questions or problems you have, the answer is always found in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Learn more about His Atonement, His love, His mercy, His doctrine, and His restored gospel of healing and progression. Turn to Him! Follow Him!\u201d And I would add, \u201cChoose Him.\u201d\nIn our complex world, it can be tempting to turn to society\u2019s heroes in an effort to provide clarity to life when it may seem confusing or overwhelming. We buy the clothes they sponsor, we embrace the politics they espouse, and we follow their suggestions shared on social media. This might be fine for a temporary diversion, but we must be watchful that this form of hero worship does not become our golden calf. Choosing the right hero has eternal consequences.\nWhen our family arrived in Spain to begin our service as mission leaders, we found a framed quote shared by Elder Neal&nbsp;A. Maxwell that has relevance to the heroes we choose to follow. He stated, \u201cIf you have not chosen the kingdom of God first, it will in the end make no difference what you have chosen instead.\u201d Brothers and sisters, it is by choosing Jesus Christ, the King of kings, that we choose the kingdom of God. *Any* other choice is the equivalent of choosing the arm of flesh, or a golden calf, and will ultimately fail us.\nIn the Old Testament book of Daniel, we read the account of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who clearly knew which hero to choose\u2014and it was not any of the gods of King Nebuchadnezzar. They confidently declared:\n\u201cOur God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace.&nbsp;\u2026 \n\u201cBut if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image.\u201d\nAs the Apostle Paul taught, \u201cThere be gods many,\u201d and, I may add, heroes many to whom we are invited to bow down, to worship, and to embrace. But just as Daniel\u2019s three friends knew, there is only One who is guaranteed to deliver\u2014because He already has and He always will.\nFor us on our journey back to the presence of God, to our promised land, it\u2019s not the politician, the musician, the athlete, or the vlogger that is the issue but, rather, choosing to allow them to become the primary objects of our attention and focus in place of our Savior and Redeemer.\nWe choose Him, Jesus Christ, when we choose to honor His day whether we\u2019re at home or traveling on vacation. We choose Him when we choose His words through the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets. We choose Him when we choose to hold a temple recommend and live worthy of its use. We choose Him when we are peacemakers and refuse to be contentious, \u201c*especially* when we have differences of opinion.\u201d\nNo leader has ever shown more courage, no humanitarian has shown more kindness, no physician has cured more disease, and no artist has been more creative than Jesus Christ.\nIn a world of heroes, with monuments and museums devoted to the exploits of mortal men and women, there is One who stands above all others. I testify that Jesus Christ is not only our hero; He is our Lord and King, the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "My beloved brothers and sisters, in this conference we have been blessed with an outpouring of revelation. Servants of the Lord Jesus Christ have spoken and will speak words of truth, encouragement, and direction.\nI have been touched by the testimonies borne in this conference that the Lord speaks to us personally through the Holy Ghost. As we pray and then heed the Spirit\u2019s promptings, we gain greater insights and blessings to guide us through the increasingly difficult days ahead.\nWe have heard again President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson\u2019s warning that \u201cin coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.\u201d\nThat prophetic warning has led me to ponder what I might teach my children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren about how to have that crucial guidance in the difficult days ahead for them.\nSo this message today is a brief letter to my descendants that might help them when I am not with them in the exciting days ahead. I want them to know what I have come to know that could help them.\nI have come to better understand what it will take for them to have the constant influence of the Holy Ghost in the days in which they will live. And I have felt impressed to speak today of my personal experience of inviting the Holy Ghost, as nearly as I could, to be my constant companion. My prayer is that I may be able to encourage them.\nI would start them to think about and pray about Helaman\u2019s sons, Nephi and Lehi, and the other servants of the Lord laboring with them. They faced fierce opposition. They were serving in a wicked place and had to deal with terrible deceptions. I take courage, and you could, from this one verse from the record of Helaman:\n\u201cAnd in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much strife. But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.\u201d\nThis account encourages me, and it could encourage you. Helaman\u2019s sons were taught and guided by a series of experiences with the Holy Ghost. This assures me that we can be taught by and learn from the Spirit line upon line, receiving what we need, and then when we are ready, we will receive more.\nI have been encouraged in the same way by the account of Nephi being asked to go back to Jerusalem for the plates of Laban. You remember the choice he made. He said, \u201cI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded.\u201d\nNephi\u2019s experience with the Holy Ghost on that errand has given me courage many times when I have embarked on tasks I knew were assignments from the Lord but which seemed far beyond my past experience and beyond what I saw as my capacity.\nYou remember what Nephi said about his experience: \u201cAnd it was by night; and I caused that [my brothers] should hide themselves without the walls. And after they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.\u201d\nHe goes on to say, \u201cAnd I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.\u201d\nI have been encouraged by knowing that Nephi was guided by the Spirit minute by minute through the night on the Lord\u2019s errand.\nWe need, and you will need, the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Now, we desire it, yet we know from experience that it is not easy to achieve. We each think and say and do things in our daily lives that can offend the Spirit.\nWhen that happens, as it will, we may feel disapproval from the Lord. And we may be tempted to feel we are alone. It is important to remember the sure promise we receive each week as we repent and partake of the sacrament: \u201cThat they may always have his Spirit to be with them.\u201d\nIf you have felt the influence of the Holy Ghost today, you may take it as a sweet evidence that the Atonement is working in your life.\nAs Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland has said: \u201cWhenever these moments of our extremity come, we must not succumb to the fear that God has abandoned us or that He does not hear our prayers. He *does* hear us. He *does* see us. He *does* love us.\u201d\nThat assurance has helped me. When I feel distant from the Lord, when answers to my prayers seem delayed, I have learned to follow the counsel of President Nelson to review my life for opportunities to repent. He reminds us, \u201cDaily repentance is the pathway to purity, and purity brings power.\u201d\nIf you find yourself having difficulty in feeling the Holy Ghost, you might ponder whether there is anything for which you might repent and receive forgiveness. You can pray with faith to know what to do to be cleansed and thus more nearly qualify for that constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.\nIf you want to receive the companionship of the Holy Ghost, you must want it for the right reasons. Your purposes must be the Lord\u2019s purposes. If your motives are too selfish, you will find it difficult to receive and sense the promptings of the Spirit.\nThe key for me and for you is to want what the Savior wants. Our motives need to be driven by the pure love of Christ. Our prayers need to be \u201cAll I want is what you want. Thy will be done.\u201d\nI try to remember the Savior\u2019s sacrifice and His love for me. Then, when I pray to Heavenly Father to give thanks, I feel love and assurance that my prayers are heard and that I will receive whatever is best for me and those I love. It strengthens my testimony.\nOf all the things of which the Holy Ghost testifies, the most precious for us is that Jesus is the Christ, the living Son of God. The Savior promised, \u201cWhen the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.\u201d\nYears ago I received a phone call from a distraught mother. She told me that her daughter had moved far from home. She sensed from the little contact she had with her daughter that something was terribly wrong. She pleaded with me to help.\nI found out who the daughter\u2019s home teacher was. You can tell by that name that it was a long time ago. I called him. He was young. Yet he told me that he and his companion both had been awakened in the night with not only concern for the daughter but with inspiration that she was about to make choices that would bring sadness and misery. With only that inspiration of the Spirit, they went to see her.\nAt first she did not want to tell them about her situation. Under inspiration, they pleaded with her to repent and choose the path the Lord had for her. She realized then, I believe by the Spirit, that the only way they could have known what they knew about her life was from God. A mother turned her loving concerns over to Heavenly Father and the Savior. The Holy Ghost had been sent to those home teachers because they were willing to serve the Lord. They had followed the counsel and promise found in the Doctrine and Covenants:\n\u201cLet thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.\n\u201cThe Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.\u201d\nI testify that the Lord has kept His promise. The Holy Ghost is being sent to the faithful covenant members of the Church of Jesus Christ. Now, your experiences will be unique, and the Spirit will guide in the way best suited to your faith and capacity to receive revelation for you and for those you love and serve. I pray with all my heart that your confidence will grow.\nI bear my witness that God the Father lives. He loves you. He hears your every prayer. Jesus Christ did pray to the Father to send the Holy Ghost to guide, comfort, and testify of truth to us. The Father and His Beloved Son appeared to Joseph Smith in a grove of trees. The Prophet Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God.\nHeavenly messengers restored priesthood keys. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson is the prophet of God for all the earth.\nAs a witness of Jesus Christ, I know that He lives and He leads His Church. You and I have the opportunity to have the Holy Ghost as our constant companion and to have those truths confirmed as we remember and love the Savior, repent, and ask for His love to be in our hearts. I pray that we may have that blessing and the companionship of the Holy Spirit this day and every day of our lives. I love you. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "In 1907 a wealthy Englishman named George Herbert, the fifth Earl of Carnarvon, moved to Egypt and took up an interest in archaeology. He approached a well-known Egyptologist, Howard Carter, and proposed a partnership. Carter would oversee their archaeological excavations, and Carnarvon would provide the funding.\nTogether they successfully explored a variety of locations. Then they received permission to excavate in the Valley of the Kings, located near modern-day Luxor, where the tombs of many pharaohs had been found. They decided to look for the tomb of King Tutankhamun. Tutankhamun had ascended to the throne of Egypt more than 3,000 years earlier and reigned for 10 years before his unexpected death. He was known to have been buried in the Valley of the Kings, but the location of his tomb was unknown. \nCarter and Carnarvon spent five years unsuccessfully searching for Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb. Eventually Carnarvon informed Carter that he was finished with the fruitless quest. Carter pleaded for just one more season of excavation, and Carnarvon relented and agreed to the funding. \nCarter realized that the entire floor of the Valley of the Kings had been methodically excavated\u2014except the area of their own base camp. Within a few days of digging there, they found the first steps leading down to the tomb.\nWhen Carter eventually peered into the antechamber of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb, he saw gold everywhere. After three months of cataloging the contents of the antechamber, they opened the sealed burial chamber in February 1923\u2014100 years ago. This was the most famous archaeological find of the 20th century. \nDuring those years of ineffectual searching, Carter and Carnarvon had overlooked what was literally under their feet. Some five centuries before the Savior\u2019s birth, the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob referred to taking for granted or undervaluing what is nearby as \u201clooking beyond the mark.\u201d Jacob foresaw that the people of Jerusalem would not recognize the promised Messiah when He came. Jacob prophesied that they would be a \u201cpeople [who] despised the words of plainness&nbsp;\u2026 and [would seek] for things that they could not understand. Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness [would come] by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall.\u201d In other words, they would stumble.\nJacob\u2019s prediction proved accurate. During Jesus\u2019s mortal ministry, many looked beyond the mark, beyond Him. They looked past the Savior of the world. Instead of recognizing His role in fulfilling Heavenly Father\u2019s plan, they condemned and crucified Him. They looked and waited for someone else to bring them salvation. \nLike those people in Jerusalem, and like Carter and Carnarvon, we too can be prone to look beyond the mark. We need to guard against this tendency lest we miss Jesus Christ in our lives and fail to recognize the many blessings He offers us. We need Him. We are counseled to rely \u201cwholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.\u201d\nHe is our mark. If we incorrectly imagine that there is a need for something beyond what He offers, we deny or diminish the scope and power He can have in our lives. He has claimed the rights of mercy and extends that mercy to us. He is the ultimate \u201csource [to whom we should] look for a remission of [our] sins.\u201d He is our Advocate with the Father and champions what the Father has wanted all along: for us to return to Him as inheritors in His kingdom. We need to, in the words of the prophet Alma, \u201ccast about [our] eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for [our] sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection.\u201d Jesus Christ is our treasure.\nThe Savior has given us many ways to focus on Him intentionally, including the daily opportunity to repent. Sometimes we undervalue how great this offered blessing is. When I was eight years old, I was baptized by my father. Afterward, I held his hand as we were going to cross a busy street. I was not paying attention and stepped from the curb just as a big truck came rumbling by. My father jerked me back, out of the street and onto the curb. Had he not done so, I would have been hit by the truck. Knowing my own mischievous nature, I thought, \u201cMaybe it would have been better for me to be killed by the truck because I\u2019ll never be as clean as I am now right after my baptism.\u201d \nAs an eight-year-old, I had mistakenly presumed that the water of baptism washed away sins. Not so. In the years since my baptism, I have learned that sins are cleansed by the power of Jesus Christ through His atoning sacrifice as we make and keep the baptismal covenant. Then, through the gift of repentance, we can remain clean. I have also learned that the sacrament brings a powerful virtuous cycle into our lives, enabling us to retain a remission of our sins. \nJust like the treasure that was under the feet of Carter and Carnarvon, the treasured blessings of the sacrament are available to us each time we attend sacrament meeting. We are promised that the Holy Ghost will be our constant companion if we approach the sacrament the way a new convert approaches baptism and confirmation, with a broken heart and contrite spirit and a determination to live up to that baptismal covenant. The Holy Ghost blesses us with His sanctifying power so that we can always retain a remission of our sins, week in and week out. \nOur spiritual foundation is strengthened through repentance and by conscientiously preparing for and worthily partaking of the sacrament. Only with a robust spiritual foundation can we handle the metaphorical rain, wind, and floods that confront us in our lives. Conversely, our spiritual foundation is weakened when we voluntarily skip sacrament meeting or when we do not focus on the Savior during the sacrament. We may unintentionally \u201cwithdraw [ourselves] from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in [us] to guide [us] in wisdom\u2019s paths that [we] may be blessed, prospered, and preserved.\u201d \nWhen we have the Holy Ghost with us, we will be inspired and guided to make and keep other covenants, such as those we make in temples. Doing so deepens our relationship with God. You may have noticed that many new temples have been announced in recent years, bringing temples ever closer to members. Paradoxically, as temples become more accessible, it may be easier for us to become more casual about temple attendance. When temples are distant, we plan our time and resources to travel to the temple to worship there. We prioritize these journeys.\nWith a temple close at hand, it can be easy to let little things get in the way of attending, saying to ourselves, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just go another time.\u201d Living close to a temple does bring greater flexibility in scheduling time in the temple, but that very flexibility can make it easier to take the temple for granted. When we do, we \u201cmiss the mark,\u201d undervaluing the opportunity to draw closer to the Savior in His holy house. Our commitment to attend should be at least as strong when the temple is nearby as when it is distant. \nAfter Carter and Carnarvon excavated elsewhere in the Valley of the Kings looking for Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb, they realized their oversight. We do not need to labor unsuccessfully, as they did for a time, to find our treasure. Nor need we seek counsel from exotic sources, prizing the novelty of the source and thinking such counsel will be more enlightened than that which we can receive from a humble prophet of God.\nAs recorded in the Old Testament, when Naaman sought a cure for his leprosy, he was indignant at being asked to dip himself seven times in a nearby ordinary river. But he was persuaded to follow the prophet Elisha\u2019s counsel rather than rely on his own preconceived notions of how the miracle should occur. As a result, Naaman was healed. When we trust God\u2019s prophet on the earth today and act on his counsel, we will find happiness, and we too can be healed. We need to look no further. \nBrothers and sisters, I encourage you to remember and always focus on Jesus Christ. He is our Savior and Redeemer, the \u201cmark\u201d to whom we should look, and our greatest treasure. As you come to Him, you will be rewarded with strength to face life\u2019s challenges, courage to do what is right, and the ability to fulfill your mission in mortality. Treasure the opportunity to repent, the privilege of partaking of the sacrament, the blessing of making and keeping temple covenants, the delight of worshipping in the temple, and the joy of having a living prophet.\nI bear my solemn and sure witness that God, the Eternal Father, is our Heavenly Father and that He lives; Jesus is the Christ; He is our kind, wise heavenly Friend; and this is His restored Church. Thank you for your faith and faithfulness. I pray that you will be blessed, prospered, and preserved, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Brothers and sisters, thank you for your devotion to God the Father and to His Son, Jesus Christ, and thank you for your love and service to each other. You truly are remarkable!\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter my wife, Anne, and I received a call to serve as full-time mission leaders, our family determined to learn each missionary\u2019s name before arriving in the field. We obtained photos, created flash cards, and began studying faces and memorizing names.\nOnce we arrived, we held introductory conferences with the missionaries. As we mingled, I overheard our nine-year-old son:\n\u201cNice to meet you, Sam!\u201d\n\u201cRachel, where are you from?\u201d\n\u201cWow, David, you\u2019re tall!\u201d\nAlarmed, I went to our son and whispered, \u201cHey, let\u2019s remember to refer to the missionaries as Elder or Sister.\u201d\nHe gave me a puzzled look and said, \u201cDad, I thought we were supposed to memorize their *names*.\u201d Our son did what he thought was right based on his understanding.\nSo, what is our understanding of truth in today\u2019s world? We are constantly bombarded with strong opinions, biased reporting, and incomplete data. At the same time, the volume and sources of this information are proliferating. Our need to recognize truth has never been more important!\nTruth is critical for us to establish and strengthen our relationship with God, find peace and joy, and reach our divine potential. Today, let us consider the following questions:\n\n\nWhat is truth, and why is it important?\n\n\nHow do we find truth?\n\n\nWhen we find truth, how can we share it?\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth Is Eternal\n\nThe Lord has taught us in scripture that \u201ctruth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come\u201d ([[D&C 93|Doctrine and Covenants 93:24]]). It \u201cwas not created or made\u201d ([[D&C 93|Doctrine and Covenants 93:29]]) and has \u201cno end\u201d ([[D&C 88|Doctrine and Covenants 88:66]]). Truth is absolute, fixed, and immutable. In other words, truth is eternal.\nTruth helps us avoid deception, discern good from evil, receive protection, and find comfort and healing. Truth can also guide our actions, make us free, sanctify us, and lead us to eternal life.\n\n\n\n\nGod Reveals Eternal Truth\n\nGod reveals eternal truth to us through a *network of revelatory relationships* involving Himself, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, prophets, and us. Let us discuss the distinct yet interconnected roles each participant plays in this process.\nFirst, God is *the* source of eternal truth. He and His Son, Jesus Christ, have a perfect understanding of truth and always act in harmony with true principles and laws. This power allows Them to create and govern worlds as well as to love, guide, and nurture each one of us perfectly. They want *us* to understand and apply truth so *we* can enjoy the blessings They do. They may impart truth in person or, more typically, through messengers such as the Holy Ghost, angels, or living prophets.\nSecond, the Holy Ghost testifies of all truth. He reveals truths to us directly and witnesses of truth taught by others. Impressions from the Spirit typically come as thoughts to our minds and feelings to our hearts.\nThird, prophets receive truth from God and share that truth with us. We learn the truth from past prophets in the scriptures and from living prophets at general conference and through other official channels.\nFinally, you and I play a crucial role in this process. God expects us to seek, recognize, and act on truth. Our ability to receive and apply truth is dependent on the strength of our relationship with the Father and the Son, our responsiveness to the influence of the Holy Ghost, and our alignment with latter-day prophets.\nWe need to remember that Satan works to keep us from truth. He knows that without truth, we cannot gain eternal life. He weaves strands of truth with worldly philosophies to confuse us and distract us from what is communicated by God.\n\n\n\nSeeking, Recognizing, and Applying Eternal Truth\n\nAs we seek eternal truth, the following two questions can help us recognize whether a concept comes from God or from another source:\n\n\nIs the concept taught consistently in the scriptures and by living prophets?\n\n\nIs the concept confirmed by the witness of the Holy Ghost?\n\n\nGod reveals doctrinal truths through prophets, and the Holy Ghost confirms those truths to us and helps us apply them. We must seek and be prepared to receive these spiritual impressions when they come. We are most receptive to the witness of the Spirit when we are humble, pray sincerely and study God\u2019s words, and keep His commandments.\nOnce the Holy Ghost confirms a specific truth to us, our understanding deepens as we put that principle into practice. Over time, as we consistently live the principle, we gain a sure knowledge of that truth.\nFor example, I have made mistakes and felt remorse for poor choices. But through prayer, study, and faith in Jesus Christ, I received a witness of the principle of repentance. As I continued to repent, my understanding of repentance grew stronger. I felt closer to God and His Son. I now *know* that sin can be forgiven through Jesus Christ, because I experience the blessings of repentance each day.\n\n\n\n\nTrusting God When Truth Is Not Yet Revealed\n\nSo, what should we do when we sincerely seek for truth not yet revealed? I have empathy for those of us who yearn for answers that do not seem to come.\nTo Joseph Smith, the Lord counseled, \u201cHold your peace until I shall see fit to make all things known \u2026 concerning the matter\u201d ([[D&C 10|Doctrine and Covenants 10:37]]).\nAnd to Emma Smith, He explained, \u201cMurmur not because of the things which thou hast not seen, for they are withheld from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come\u201d ([[D&C 25|Doctrine and Covenants 25:4]]).\nI too have sought answers to heartfelt questions. Many answers have come; some have not. As we hold on\u2014trusting God\u2019s wisdom and love, keeping His commandments, and relying on what we *do* know\u2014He helps us find peace until He reveals the truth of all things.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Doctrine and Policy\n\nWhen seeking truth, it helps to understand the difference between doctrine and policy. Doctrine refers to eternal truths, such as the nature of the Godhead, the plan of salvation, and Jesus Christ\u2019s atoning sacrifice. Policy is the application of doctrine based on current circumstances. Policy helps us administer the Church in an orderly way.\nWhile doctrine never changes, policy adjusts from time to time. The Lord works through His prophets to uphold His doctrine *and* to modify Church policies according to the needs of His children.\nUnfortunately, we sometimes confuse policy with doctrine. If we do not understand the difference, we risk becoming disillusioned when policies change and may even begin to question God\u2019s wisdom or the revelatory role of prophets.\n\n\n\nTeaching Eternal Truth\n\nWhen we obtain truth from God, He encourages us to share that knowledge with others. We do this when we teach a class, guide a child, or discuss gospel truths with a friend.\n*Our aim is to teach truth in a way that invites the converting power of the Holy Ghost*. Let me share some simple invitations from the Lord and His prophets that can help.\n\n\nCenter on Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and Their fundamental doctrine.\n\n\nStay grounded in the scriptures and the teachings of latter-day prophets.\n\n\nRely on doctrine established through multiple authoritative witnesses.\n\n\nAvoid speculation, personal opinions, or worldly ideas.\n\n\nTeach a point of doctrine within the context of related gospel truths.\n\n\nUse teaching methods that invite the influence of the Spirit.\n\n\nCommunicate clearly to avoid misunderstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking Truth in Love\n\nHow we teach truth really matters. Paul encouraged us to speak \u201cthe truth in love\u201d (see [[Ephesians 4|Ephesians 4:14\u201315]]). Truth has the best chance of blessing another when conveyed with Christlike love.\nTruth taught without love can cause feelings of judgment, discouragement, and loneliness. It often leads to resentment and division\u2014even conflict. On the other hand, love without truth is hollow and lacks the promise of growth.\nBoth truth and love are essential for our spiritual development. Truth provides the doctrine, principles, and laws necessary to gain eternal life, while love engenders the motivation needed to embrace and act upon what is true.\nI am forever grateful for others who patiently taught me eternal truth with love.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, let me share *eternal truths* that have become an anchor to my soul. I have come to know these truths by following the principles discussed today.\nI know that God is our Heavenly Father. He is all knowing, all powerful, and perfectly loving. He created a plan for us to gain eternal life and become like Him.\nAs part of that plan, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to help us. Jesus taught us to do the Father\u2019s will and to love one another. He atoned for our sins and gave up His life on the cross. He arose from the dead after three days. Through Christ and His grace, we will be resurrected, we can be forgiven, and we can find strength in affliction.\nDuring His earthly ministry, Jesus established His Church. Over time, that Church was changed, and truths were lost. Jesus Christ restored His Church and the truths of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. And today, Christ continues to lead His Church through living prophets and apostles.\nI know that as we come unto Christ, we can eventually \u201cbe perfected in him\u201d ([[Moroni 10|Moroni 10:32]]), obtain \u201ca fulness of joy\u201d ([[D&C 93|Doctrine and Covenants 93:33]]), and receive \u201call that [the] Father hath\u201d ([[D&C 84|Doctrine and Covenants 84:38]]). To these eternal truths I bear witness in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Despite our earnest efforts, some of us may still struggle to feel the Spirit due to mental health challenges. Depression, anxiety, and other neurological conditions can add complexity to recognizing the Holy Ghost. In such cases, the Lord invites us to continue living the gospel, and He will bless us (see [[Mosiah 2|Mosiah 2:41]]). We can look for additional activities\u2014such as listening to sacred music, engaging in service, or spending time in nature\u2014that help us feel the fruits of the Spirit (see [[Galatians 5|Galatians 5:22\u201323]]) and strengthen our connection to God.\nElder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland expressed: \u201cSo how do you best respond when mental or emotional challenges confront you or those you love? Above all, never lose faith in your Father in Heaven, who loves you more than you can comprehend. \u2026 Faithfully pursue the time-tested devotional practices that bring the Spirit of the Lord into your life. Seek the counsel of those who hold keys for your spiritual well-being. Ask for and cherish priesthood blessings.

There is a light that emanates from every newborn, bringing a special bond of love that can fill their parents\u2019 hearts with joy. A Mexican writer wrote, \u201cI have learned that when a newborn first squeezes his father\u2019s finger in his tiny fist, he has caught him forever.\u201d\nParenting is one of life\u2019s most extraordinary experiences. Parents enter a partnership with their Heavenly Father to guide their precious children back to heaven. Today I would like to share some parenting lessons found in the scriptures and taught by living prophets to help us leave our parental legacy.\n\n\nClimb to the Higher Ground of Gospel Culture\n\nWe must climb to the higher ground of gospel culture with our families. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson declared: \u201cFamilies deserve guidance from heaven. Parents cannot counsel children adequately from personal experience, fear, or sympathy.\u201d\nAlthough our cultural backgrounds, parenting styles, and personal experiences may be valuable for parenting, these abilities are insufficient to help our children return to heaven. We need access to a more elevated \u201cset of values and \u2026 practices,\u201d a culture of both love and expectations, where we interact with our children \u201cin a higher, holier way.\u201d President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks described gospel culture as \u201ca distinctive way of life, a set of values and expectations and practices. \u2026 This gospel culture comes from the plan of salvation, the commandments of God, and the teachings of \u2026 living prophets. It guides us in the way we raise our families and live our individual lives.\u201d\nJesus Christ is the center of this gospel culture. Adopting the gospel culture in our families is critical to creating a fertile environment where the seed of faith may flourish. To climb to higher ground, President Oaks invited us \u201cto give up any personal or family traditions or practices that are contrary to the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ.\u201d Parents, timidity on our part to establish gospel culture may allow the adversary to establish a foothold in our homes or, even worse, in the hearts of our children.\nAs we choose to make the gospel culture the predominant culture in our family, then by the powerful influence of the Holy Ghost, our current parenting styles, traditions, and practices will be sifted, aligned, refined, and enhanced.\n\n\n\nMake Home the Center of Gospel Learning\n\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught that the home should be the \u201ccenter of gospel learning.\u201d The purpose of gospel learning is to \u201cdeepen our conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and help us become more like Them.\u201d Let\u2019s consider three crucial parenting responsibilities described by prophets and apostles that can help us establish a higher gospel culture in our homes.\n\n\nFirst: Teach Freely\n\nHeavenly Father instructed Adam concerning Jesus Christ and His doctrine. He taught him \u201cto teach these things freely unto [his] children.\u201d In other words, Heavenly Father taught Adam to teach these things liberally, generously, and without restraint. The scriptures tell us that \u201cAdam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known unto their sons and their daughters.\u201d\nWe teach our children generously when we spend meaningful time with them. We teach without restraint when discussing sensitive topics such as screen time, using resources that the Church has made available. We teach liberally when we study the scriptures with our children using Come, Follow Me and allow the Spirit to be the teacher.\n\n\n\nSecond: Model Discipleship\n\nIn the book of John, we read that when several Jews questioned the Savior about His conduct, Jesus directed attention to His model, His Father. He taught, \u201cThe Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\u201d Parents, what do we need to model for our children? Discipleship.\nAs parents, we can teach the importance of putting God first when we discuss the first commandment, but we model it when we set aside worldly distractions and keep the Sabbath day holy every week. We can teach the importance of temple covenants when we speak about the doctrine of celestial marriage, but we model it when we honor our covenants, treating our spouse with dignity.\n\n\n\nThird: Invite to Act\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ should be the core of our children\u2019s testimonies, and these testimonies must come to each child through individual revelation. To assist our children with the building of their testimonies, we encourage them to use their agency to choose what is right and prepare them for a lifetime on God\u2019s covenant path.\nIt would be wise to encourage each of our children to accept President Nelson\u2019s invitation to take charge of his or her own testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel\u2014to work for it, to nurture it so that it will grow, to feed it truth, and to not pollute it with false philosophies of unbelieving men and women.\n\n\n\n\nRighteous, Intentional Parenting\n\nOur Heavenly Father\u2019s divine intentions as a parent were made known in a revelation given to Moses: \u201cFor behold, this is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\u201d President Nelson has added, \u201cGod will do everything He can, short of violating your agency, to help you not miss out on the greatest blessings in all eternity.\u201d\nAs parents, we are God\u2019s agents in the care of our children. We must do everything we can to create an environment where our children can feel His divine influence.\nHeavenly Father never intended for us as parents to sit on the sidelines as spectators, watching the spiritual lives of our children unfold. Let me illustrate this idea of intentional parenting with a personal experience. When I was attending Primary in a small branch in Guatemala, my parents began to teach me about the value of patriarchal blessings. My mother took the time to share her experience of receiving her treasured patriarchal blessing. She taught me the doctrine related to patriarchal blessings, and she testified of promised blessings. Her intentional parenting inspired me to have the desire to receive my patriarchal blessing.\nWhen I was 12, my parents helped me navigate the search for a patriarch. This was necessary because there was no patriarch in the district where we lived. I traveled to a patriarch that was in a stake 156 kilometers (97 miles) away. I distinctly remember when the patriarch laid his hands upon my head to bless me. I knew by powerful spiritual confirmation, without a doubt, that my Heavenly Father knew me.\nFor a 12-year-old boy from a small town, that meant everything to me. My heart turned to my Heavenly Father that day because of my mother and father\u2019s intentional parenting, and I will be forever grateful to them.\nSister Joy&nbsp;D. Jones, former Primary General President, taught: \u201cWe cannot wait for conversion to simply happen to our children. Accidental conversion is *not* a principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d Our love and inspired invitations can make a difference in how our children use their agency. President Nelson emphasized, \u201cNo other work transcends that of righteous, intentional parenting!\u201d\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nParents, this world is full of philosophies, cultures, and ideas competing for our children\u2019s attention. The great and spacious building advertises its membership daily using the most current media channels. \u201cBut in the gift of his Son,\u201d the prophet Moroni taught, \u201chath God prepared a more excellent way.\u201d\nAs we partner with God through covenants and become His agents in the care of our children, He will sanctify our intentions, inspire our teachings, and temper our invitations so \u201cour children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

My seven older sisters insisted my parents name me \u201cKimo,\u201d a Hawaiian name. We lived near the Laie Hawaii Temple when it served much of the Church membership of the Asia Pacific Area, including Japan. At this time, groups of Japanese Saints began coming to Hawaii to receive the blessings of the temple.\nOne of these members was a sister from the beautiful island of Okinawa. The story of her journey to the Hawaii Temple is remarkable. Two decades earlier, she had been married in a traditional arranged Buddhist wedding. Just a few months later, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, thrusting the United States into a conflict with Japan. In the wake of battles such as Midway and Iwo Jima, the tides of war pushed the Japanese forces back to the shores of her island home, Okinawa, the last line of defense standing against the Allied forces before the heartlands of Japan.\nFor a harrowing three months in 1945, the Battle of Okinawa raged. A flotilla of 1,300 American warships encircled and bombarded the island. Military and civilian casualties were enormous. Today a solemn monument in Okinawa lists more than 240,000 known names of people who perished in the battle.\nIn a desperate attempt to escape the onslaught, this Okinawan woman, her husband, and their two small children sought refuge in a mountain cave. They endured unspeakable misery through the ensuing weeks and months.\nOne desperate night amidst the battle, with her family near starvation and her husband unconscious, she contemplated ending their suffering with a hand grenade, which the authorities had supplied to her and others for that purpose. However, as she prepared to do so, a profoundly spiritual experience unfolded that gave her a tangible sense of the reality of God and His love for her, which gave her the strength to carry on. In the following days, she revived her husband and fed her family with weeds, honey from a wild beehive, and creatures caught in a nearby stream. Remarkably, they endured six months in the cave until local villagers informed them that the battle had ended.\nWhen the family returned home and began rebuilding their lives, this Japanese woman started searching for answers about God. She gradually kindled a belief in Jesus Christ and the need to be baptized. However, she was concerned about her loved ones who had died without a knowledge of Jesus Christ and baptism, including her mother, who died giving birth to her.\nImagine her joy when two sister missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came to her house one day and taught her that people can learn about Jesus Christ in the spirit world. She was captivated by the teaching that her parents could choose to follow Jesus Christ after death and accept baptism performed on their behalf in holy places called temples. She and her family were converted to the Savior and baptized.\nHer family worked hard and began to prosper, adding three more children. They were faithful and active in the Church. Then, unexpectedly, her husband suffered a stroke and died, compelling her to work long hours at multiple jobs for many years to provide for her five children.\nSome people in her family and neighborhood criticized her. They blamed her troubles on her decision to join a Christian church. Undeterred by profound tragedy and harsh criticism, she held on to her faith in Jesus Christ, determined to press forward, trusting that God knew her and that brighter days were ahead.\nA few years following her husband\u2019s untimely death, the mission president of Japan felt inspired to encourage the Japanese members to work toward attending the temple. The mission president was an American veteran of the Battle of Okinawa, in which the Okinawan sister and her family had suffered so much. Nonetheless, the humble sister said of him: \u201cHe was then one of our hated enemies, but now he was here with the gospel of love and peace. This, to me, was a miracle.\u201d\nUpon hearing the mission president\u2019s message, the widowed sister desired to be sealed to her family in the temple someday. However, it was impossible for her, due to financial constraints and language barriers.\nThen several innovative solutions emerged. The cost could be reduced by half if members in Japan chartered an entire plane to fly to Hawaii in the offseason. Members also recorded and sold vinyl records entitled *Japanese Saints Sing*. Some members even sold homes. Others quit their jobs to make the trip.\nThe other challenge for members was that the temple presentation was not available in Japanese. Church leaders called a Japanese brother to travel to the Hawaiian temple to translate the endowment ceremony. He was the first Japanese convert after the war, having been taught and baptized by faithful American soldiers.\nWhen the endowed Japanese members living in Hawaii first heard the translation, they wept. One member recorded: \u201cWe\u2019ve been to the temple many, many times. We\u2019ve heard the ceremonies in English. [But] we have never felt the spirit of \u2026 temple work as we feel it now [hearing it] in our own native tongue.\u201d\nLater that same year, 161 adults and children embarked from Tokyo to make their way to the Hawaii Temple. One Japanese brother reflected on the journey: \u201cAs I looked out of the airplane and saw Pearl Harbor, and remembered what our country had done to these people on December&nbsp;7, 1941, I feared in my heart. Will they accept us? But to my surprise they showed greater love and kindness than I had ever seen in my life.\u201d\n\nUpon the Japanese Saints\u2019 arrival, the Hawaiian members welcomed them with countless strands of flower leis while exchanging hugs and kisses on the cheeks, a custom foreign to Japanese culture. After spending 10 transformative days in Hawaii, the Japanese Saints bid their farewells to the melody of \u201cAloha Oe\u201d sung by the Hawaiian Saints.\nThe second temple trip organized for Japanese members included the widowed Okinawan sister. She made the 10,000-mile (16,000-km) journey thanks to a generous gift from missionaries who had served in her branch and had eaten many meals at her table. While in the temple, she shed tears of joy as she acted as a proxy for her mother\u2019s baptism and was sealed to her deceased husband.\nTemple excursions from Japan to Hawaii continued regularly until the Tokyo Japan Temple was dedicated in 1980, becoming the 18th temple in operation. In November of this year, the 186th temple will be dedicated in Okinawa, Japan. It is located not far from the cave in central Okinawa where this woman and her family sheltered.\nThough I never met this wonderful sister from Okinawa, her legacy lives on through her faithful posterity, many of whom I know and love.\nMy father, a World War II veteran of the Pacific, was thrilled when I received my call to serve in Japan as a young missionary. I arrived in Japan shortly after the Tokyo Temple was dedicated and saw firsthand their love for the temple.\nTemple covenants are gifts from our Heavenly Father to the faithful followers of His Son, Jesus Christ. Through the temple, our Heavenly Father binds individuals and families to the Savior and to each other.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson declared last year:\n\u201cEach person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples\u2014and keeps them\u2014has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cThe reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power\u2014power that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better. This power eases our way.\u201d\nThrough temple blessings, the Savior heals individuals, families, and nations\u2014even those that once stood as bitter enemies. The resurrected Lord declared to a conflict-ridden society in the Book of Mormon that unto those who honor \u201cmy name, shall the Son of Righteousness arise with healing in his wings.\u201d\nI am grateful to witness the ongoing fulfillment of the Lord\u2019s promise that \u201cthe time shall come when the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,\u201d including to those \u201cupon the isles of the sea.\u201d\nI testify of the Savior Jesus Christ and of His prophet and apostles in these latter days. I solemnly bear witness of the heavenly power to bind in heaven what is bound on earth.\nThis is the Savior\u2019s work, and temples are His holy house.\nWith unwavering conviction, I declare these truths in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

While in the temple, she shed tears of joy as she acted as a proxy for her mother\u2019s baptism and was sealed to her deceased husband."

        "full_markdown": "Our Primary children sing, \u201cLove is spoken here.\u201d\nI once gave Sister Gong a small locket. I had it inscribed *dot-dot, dot-dot, dot-dot-dash*. Those familiar with Morse code will recognize the letters I, I, U. But I included a second code. In Mandarin Chinese, \u201cai\u201d means \u201clove.\u201d So, double-decoded, the message was \u201cI love you.\u201d Susan, sweetheart, \u201cI, ai (\u7231), U.\u201d\nWe speak love in many languages. I am told the human family speaks 7,168 living languages. In the Church we speak 575 documented primary languages, with many dialects. We also communicate intent, inflection, and emotion through art, music, dance, logical symbols, and inter- and intrapersonal expression.\nToday, let us speak of three languages of gospel love: the language of warmth and reverence, the language of service and sacrifice, and the language of covenant belonging.\nFirst, the gospel language of warmth and reverence.\nWith warmth and reverence, Sister Gong asks children and youth, \u201cHow do you know your parents and families love you?\u201d\nIn Guatemala, children say, \u201cMy parents work hard to feed our family.\u201d In North America, children say, \u201cMy parents read stories and tuck me into bed at night.\u201d In the Holy Land, children say, \u201cMy parents keep me safe.\u201d In Ghana, West Africa, children say, \u201cMy parents help me with my Children and Youth goals.\u201d\nOne child said, \u201cEven though she is very tired after working all day, my mother comes outside to play with me.\u201d Her mother cried when she heard that her daily sacrifices matter. A young woman said, \u201cEven though my mother and I sometimes disagree, I trust my mother.\u201d Her mother cried too.\nSometimes we need to know love spoken here is heard and appreciated here.\nWith warmth and reverence, our sacrament and other meetings focus on Jesus Christ. We speak reverently of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, personal and real, not only of atonement in the abstract. We call Jesus Christ\u2019s restored Church in His name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We use reverent prayer language when we address Heavenly Father and warm respect when we speak with each other. As we recognize Jesus Christ at the heart of temple covenants, we refer less to \u201cgoing to the temple\u201d and more to \u201ccoming to Jesus Christ in the house of the Lord.\u201d Each covenant whispers, \u201cLove is spoken here.\u201d\nNew members say Church vocabulary often requires decoding. We chuckle at the thought that \u201cstake house\u201d could mean a nice beef dinner; \u201cward building\u201d could indicate a hospital; \u201copening exercises\u201d could invite us to do head, shoulders, knees, and toes in the church parking lot. But, please, let us be understanding and kind as we learn new languages of love together. New at church, a convert was told her skirts were too short. Instead of taking offense, she replied, in effect, \u201cMy heart is converted; please be patient as my skirts catch up.\u201d\nThe words we use can draw us closer to or distance us from other Christians and friends. Sometimes we speak of missionary work, temple work, humanitarian and welfare work in ways that may cause others to think we believe we work on our own. Let us always speak with warm and reverent gratitude for God\u2019s work and glory and the merits, mercy, and grace of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.\n\nSecond, the gospel language of service and sacrifice.\nAs we gather again at church each week to honor and rejoice in the Sabbath day, we can express our sacramental covenant commitment to Jesus Christ and each other through our Church callings, fellowship, sociality, and service.\nWhen I ask local Church leaders what concerns them, both brothers and sisters say, \u201cSome of our members are not accepting Church calls.\u201d Calls to serve the Lord and each other in His Church give opportunity to increase in compassion, capacity, and humility. As we are set apart, we can receive the Lord\u2019s inspiration to lift and strengthen others and ourselves. Of course, the changing circumstances and seasons of our lives may affect our ability to serve, but hopefully never our desire. With King Benjamin, we say, \u201cIf I had I would give\u201d and offer all we can.\nStake and ward leaders, let\u2019s do our part. As we call (and release) brothers and sisters to serve in the Lord\u2019s Church, let\u2019s please do so with dignity and inspiration. Help each feel appreciated and that they can be successful. Please counsel with and listen to sister leaders. May we remember, as President J.&nbsp;Reuben Clark taught, in the Lord\u2019s Church we serve where called, \u201cwhich place one neither seeks nor declines.\u201d\nWhen Sister Gong and I were married, Elder David&nbsp;B. Haight counseled: \u201cAlways hold a calling in the Church. Especially when life is busy,\u201d he said, \u201cyou need to feel the Lord\u2019s love for those you serve and for you as you serve.\u201d I promise that love is spoken here, there, and everywhere as we answer yes to Church leaders to serve the Lord in His Church by His Spirit and our covenants.\nThe Lord\u2019s restored Church can be an incubator for a Zion community. As we worship, serve, enjoy, and learn His love together, we anchor each other in His gospel. We may disagree politically or on social issues but find harmony as we sing together in the ward choir. We nurture connection and fight isolation as we regularly minister with our hearts in each other\u2019s homes and neighborhoods.\nDuring member visits with stake presidents, I feel their deep love for members in every circumstance. As we drove past member homes in his stake, one stake president noted that whether we live in a home with a swimming pool or a home with a dirt floor, Church service is a privilege that often includes sacrifice. Yet, he wisely noticed, when we serve and sacrifice in the gospel together, we find fewer faults and greater peace. When we let Him, Jesus Christ helps us speak His love here.\nThis summer, our family met wonderful Church members and friends in Loughborough and Oxford, England. These meaningful gatherings reminded me how ward social and service activities can build new and enduring gospel bonds. For some time I have felt that, in many places in the Church, a few more ward activities, of course planned and implemented with gospel purpose, could knit us together with even greater belonging and unity.\nOne inspired ward activities chair and committee nurtures individuals and a community of Saints. Their well-planned activities help everybody feel valued, included, and invited to play a needed role. Such activities bridge ages and backgrounds, create lasting memories, and can be carried out with little or no cost. Enjoyable gospel activities also invite neighbors and friends.\nSociality and service often go together. Young adults know if you really want to get to know someone, then paint side by side on a ladder in a service project.\n\nOf course, no individual and no family is perfect. We all need help better to speak love here. \u201cPerfect love casteth out fear.\u201d Faith, service, and sacrifice draw us beyond ourselves closer to our Savior. The more compassionate, faithful, and selfless our service and sacrifice are in Him, the more we may begin to fathom Jesus Christ\u2019s atoning compassion and grace for us.\n\nAnd that brings us to the gospel language of covenant belonging.\nWe live in a self-centered world. So much is \u201cI choose me.\u201d It is as if we believe we know best our own self-interest and how to pursue it.\nBut ultimately it is not true. Jesus Christ personifies this powerful, ageless truth:\n\u201cFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.\n\u201cFor what is a man [or woman] profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d\nJesus Christ offers a better way\u2014relationships founded on divine covenant, stronger than the cords of death. Covenant belonging with God and each other can heal and sanctify our most cherished relationships. In truth, He knows us better and loves us more than we know or love ourselves. In truth, when we covenant all we are, we can become more than we are. God\u2019s power and wisdom can bless us with every good gift, in His time and way.\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) has made great strides in language translation. Long gone are the days when a computer might translate the idiomatic phrase \u201cThe spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak\u201d as \u201cThe wine is good, but the meat is spoiled.\u201d Interestingly, repeating extensive examples of a language teaches a computer a language more effectively than does teaching a computer the rules of grammar.\nSimilarly, our own direct, repeated experiences may be our best spiritual way to learn the gospel languages of warmth and reverence, service and sacrifice, and covenant belonging.\nSo, where and how does Jesus Christ speak to you in love?\nWhere and how do you hear His love spoken here?\nMay we each learn to speak and hear His love here, in our hearts and homes, and in our gospel callings, activities, ministering, and service.\nIn God\u2019s plan, we will each transition one day from this life into the next life. When we meet the Lord, I imagine Him saying, with words of instruction and promise, \u201cMy love is spoken here.\u201d In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

As we recognize Jesus Christ at the heart of temple covenants, we refer less to \u201cgoing to the temple\u201d and more to \u201ccoming to Jesus Christ in the house of the Lord.\u201d Each covenant whispers, \u201cLove is spoken here.\u201d"

Three weeks ago, I injured the muscles of my back. So, while I have delivered more than 100&nbsp;general conference addresses standing, today I thought I would do so sitting. I pray that the Spirit will carry my message into your hearts today.\nI recently celebrated my 99th birthday and thus commenced my 100th year of living. I am often asked the secret to living so long. A better question would be \u201cWhat have I learned in nearly a century of living?\u201d\nTime today does not allow me to answer that question fully, but may I share one of the most crucial lessons I have learned.\nI have learned that Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for us is *fabulous*, that what we do in this life really matters, and that the Savior\u2019s Atonement is what makes our Father\u2019s plan possible.\nAs I have wrestled with the intense pain caused by my recent injury, I have felt even deeper appreciation for Jesus Christ and the incomprehensible gift of His Atonement. Think of it! The Savior suffered \u201cpains and afflictions and temptations of every kind\u201d so that He can comfort us, heal us, rescue us in times of need. Jesus Christ described His experience in Gethsemane and on Calvary: \u201cWhich suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore.\u201d My injury has caused me to reflect again and again on \u201cthe greatness of the Holy One of Israel.\u201d During my healing, the Lord has manifested His divine power in peaceful and unmistakable ways.\nBecause of Jesus Christ\u2019s infinite Atonement, our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan is a perfect plan! An understanding of God\u2019s fabulous plan takes the mystery out of life and the uncertainty out of our future. It allows each of *us* to choose *how* we will live here on earth and *where* we will live forever. The baseless notion that we should \u201ceat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us\u201d is one of the most absurd lies in the universe.\nHere is the great news of God\u2019s plan: the very things that will make your *mortal* life the best *it* can be are exactly the *same* things that will make your life throughout all *eternity* the best *it* can be! Today, to assist you to qualify for the rich blessings Heavenly Father has for you, I invite you to adopt the practice of \u201cthinking celestial\u201d! Thinking celestial means being spiritually minded. We learn from the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob that \u201cto be spiritually-minded is life eternal.\u201d\n\nMortality is a master class in learning to choose the things of greatest eternal import. Far too many people live as though this life is all there is. However, your choices today will determine three things: where you will live throughout all eternity, the kind of body with which you will be resurrected, and those with whom you will live forever. So, think celestial.\nIn my first message as President of the Church, I encouraged you to begin with the end in mind. This means making the celestial kingdom your eternal goal and then carefully considering where each of your decisions while here on earth will place you in the next world.\nThe Lord has clearly taught that only men and women who are sealed as husband and wife in the temple, and who keep their covenants, will be together throughout the eternities. He said, \u201cAll covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are *not* made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise \u2026 have an end when men are dead.\u201d\nThus, if we *unwisely* choose to live *telestial* laws now, we are choosing to be resurrected with a *telestial* body. We are choosing *not* to live with our families forever.\nSo, my dear brothers and sisters, *how* and *where* and with *whom* do *you* want to live forever? You get to choose.\nWhen you make choices, I invite you to take the long view\u2014an eternal view. Put Jesus Christ first because your eternal life is dependent upon your faith in Him and in His Atonement. It is also dependent upon your obedience to His laws. Obedience paves the way for a joyful life for you today and a grand, eternal reward tomorrow.\nWhen you are confronted with a dilemma, think celestial! When tested by temptation, think celestial! When life or loved ones let you down, think celestial! When someone dies prematurely, think celestial. When someone lingers with a devastating illness, think celestial. When the pressures of life crowd in upon you, think celestial! As you recover from an accident or injury, as I am doing now, think celestial!\nAs you focus on thinking celestial, expect to encounter opposition. Decades ago, a professional colleague criticized me for having \u201ctoo much temple\u201d in me, and more than one supervisor penalized me because of my faith. I am convinced, however, that thinking celestial enhanced my career.\nAs you think celestial, your heart will gradually change. You will want to pray more often and more sincerely. Please don\u2019t let your prayers sound like a shopping list. The Lord\u2019s perspective transcends your mortal wisdom. His response to your prayers may surprise you and will help you to think celestial.\nConsider the Lord\u2019s response to Joseph Smith when he pleaded for relief in Liberty Jail. The Lord taught the Prophet that his inhumane treatment would give him experience and be for his good. \u201cIf thou endure it well,\u201d the Lord promised, \u201cGod shall exalt thee on high.\u201d The Lord was teaching Joseph to think celestial and to envision an eternal reward rather than focus on the excruciating difficulties of the day. Our prayers can be\u2014and should be\u2014living discussions with our Heavenly Father.\nAs you think celestial, you will find yourself avoiding *anything *that robs you of your agency. *Any* addiction\u2014be it gaming, gambling, debt, drugs, alcohol, anger, pornography, sex, or even food\u2014offends God. Why? Because your obsession becomes your god. You look to *it* rather than to *Him* for solace. If you struggle with an addiction, seek the spiritual and professional help you need. Please do not let an obsession rob you of your freedom to follow God\u2019s fabulous plan.\nThinking celestial will also help you obey the law of chastity. Few things will complicate your life more quickly than violating this divine law. For those who have made covenants with God, immorality is one of the quickest ways to lose your testimony.\nMany of the adversary\u2019s most relentless temptations involve violations of moral purity. The power to create life is the *one privilege* of godhood that Heavenly Father allows His mortal children to exercise. Thus, God set clear guidelines for the use of this living, divine power. Physical intimacy is *only* for a man and a woman who are married to each other.\nMuch of the world does not believe this, but public opinion is not the arbiter of truth. The Lord has declared that no unchaste person will attain the celestial kingdom. So when you make decisions regarding morality, please think celestial. And if you have been unchaste, I plead with you to repent. Come unto Christ and receive His promise of *complete* forgiveness as you fully repent of your sins.\nAs you think celestial, you will view trials and opposition in a new light. When someone you love attacks truth, think celestial, and don\u2019t question *your* testimony. The Apostle Paul prophesied that \u201cin the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\u201d\nThere is no end to the adversary\u2019s deceptions. Please be prepared. Never take counsel from those who do not believe. Seek guidance from voices you can trust\u2014from prophets, seers, and revelators and from the whisperings of the Holy Ghost, who \u201cwill show unto you *all* things what ye should do.\u201d Please do the spiritual work to increase your capacity to receive personal revelation.\nAs you think celestial, your faith will increase. When I was a young intern, my income was $15 a month. One night, my wife Dantzel asked if I was paying tithing on that meager stipend. I was not. I quickly repented and began paying the additional $1.50 in monthly tithing.\nWas the Church any different because we increased our tithing? Of course not. However, becoming a full-tithe payer changed *me*. That is when I learned that paying tithing is all about faith, not money. As I became a full-tithe payer, the windows of heaven began to open for me. I attribute several subsequent professional opportunities to our faithful payment of tithes.\nPaying tithing requires faith, and it also *builds* faith in God and His Beloved Son.\nChoosing to live a virtuous life in a sexualized, politicized world builds faith.\nSpending more time in the temple builds faith. And your service and worship in the temple will help you to think celestial. The temple is a place of revelation. There you are shown how to progress toward a celestial life. There you are drawn closer to the Savior and given greater access to His power. There you are guided in solving the problems in your life, even your most perplexing problems.\nThe ordinances and covenants of the temple are of eternal significance. We continue to build more temples to make these sacred possibilities become a reality in each of your lives. We are grateful to announce our plans to build a temple in each of the following 20&nbsp;locations:\n\n\nSavai\u2019i, Samoa\n\n\nCanc\u00fan, Mexico\n\n\nPiura, Peru\n\n\nHuancayo, Peru\n\n\nVi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile\n\n\nGoi\u00e2nia, Brazil\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Pessoa, Brazil\n\n\nCalabar, Nigeria\n\n\nCape Coast, Ghana\n\n\nLuanda, Angola\n\n\nMbuji-Mayi, Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\n\nLaoag, Philippines\n\n\nOsaka, Japan\n\n\nKahului, Maui, Hawaii\n\n\nFairbanks, Alaska\n\n\nVancouver, Washington\n\n\nColorado Springs, Colorado\n\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma\n\n\nRoanoke, Virginia\n\n\nUlaanbaatar, Mongolia\n\n\nThe Lord is directing us to build these temples to help us think celestial. God lives. Jesus is the Christ. His Church has been restored to bless all of God\u2019s children. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",
