        "full_markdown": "My dear brothers and sisters across the world, as we begin this very special time of general conference, the eyes of heaven will certainly be focused upon us. We will hear the voice of the Lord through His servants; we will feel the \u201cguiding, directing, [and] comforting\u201d influence of the Holy Ghost, and our faith will be strengthened.\nThree years ago, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson began general conference with these words: \u201cPure revelation for the questions in your heart will make this conference rewarding and unforgettable. If you have not yet sought for the ministering of the Holy Ghost to help you hear what the Lord would have you hear during these two days, I invite you to do so now. Please make this conference a time of feasting on messages from the Lord through His servants.\u201d\nThe scriptures link three words powerfully together: faith, hope, charity. The gift of hope is a priceless endowment from God.\nThe word *hope* is used for many things we want to happen. For example, \u201cI hope it won\u2019t rain,\u201d or \u201cI hope our team wins.\u201d My intent is to speak of our sacred and eternal hopes centered in Jesus Christ and the restored gospel and our \u201cconfident expectation[s] of \u2026 the promised blessings of righteousness.\u201d\n\n\nOur Hope for Eternal Life\n\nOur hope of eternal life is assured through the grace of Christ and our own choices, allowing us the remarkable blessing of returning to our heavenly home and living forever in peace and happiness with our Heavenly Father, His Beloved Son, our faithful family and precious friends, and the righteous men and women from every continent and every century.\nOn earth we experience joy and sorrow as we are tested and proven. Our victory comes through faith in Jesus Christ as we triumph over our sins, difficulties, temptations, unfairness, and the challenges of this mortal life.\nAs we strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ, we see beyond our struggles to the blessings and promises of eternity. Like a light whose brilliance grows, hope brightens the darkened world, and we see our glorious future.\n\n\n\nHope Comes from God\n\nSince the beginning, our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son have eagerly blessed the righteous with the precious gift of hope.\nAfter leaving the garden, Adam and Eve were taught by an angel of the promise of Jesus Christ. The gift of hope enlightened their lives. Adam declared, \u201cMy eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy.\u201d Eve spoke of \u201cthe joy of [their] redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.\u201d\nJust as the Holy Ghost brought hope to Adam, the power of the Lord\u2019s Spirit enlightens the faithful today, illuminating the reality of eternal life.\nThe Savior sends us a Comforter, the Holy Ghost, a companion bringing faith, hope, and peace \u201cnot as the world giveth.\u201d\n\u201cIn the world,\u201d the Savior said, \u201cye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer [keep a brightness of hope]; I have overcome the world.\u201d\nIn times of difficulty, we choose to trust the Lord in faith. We quietly pray, \u201cNot my will but thine be done.\u201d We feel the Lord\u2019s approval for our meek willingness, and we await the promised peace the Lord will send in His chosen timing.\nThe Apostle Paul taught, \u201cThe God of hope [will] fill you with \u2026 joy and peace \u2026&nbsp;, that ye may abound in hope,\u201d \u201crejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation;\u201d \u201cthrough the power of the Holy Ghost.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Lesson of Hope\n\nThe prophet Moroni knew firsthand about having hope in Christ during tribulation. He explained his harrowing situation:\n\u201cI am alone. \u2026 I have not \u2026 whither to go.\u201d\n\u201cI make not myself known \u2026 lest they should destroy me.\u201d\nRemarkably, in this dark and lonely hour, Moroni records his father\u2019s words of hope:\n\u201cIf a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it that ye shall hope for? \u2026 Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal.\u201d\nMy brothers and sisters, hope is a living gift, a gift that grows as we increase our faith in Jesus Christ. \u201cFaith is the substance of things hoped for.\u201d We build this substance\u2014the evidence blocks of our faith\u2014through prayer, temple covenants, keeping the commandments, continually feasting on the scriptures and the words of modern-day prophets, taking the sacrament, serving others, and worshipping weekly with our fellow Saints.\n\n\n\nA House of Hope\n\nTo fortify our hope in a time of increasing wickedness, the Lord has directed His prophet to dot the earth with His temples.\nAs we enter the Lord\u2019s house, we feel the Spirit of God, verifying our hope.\n\nThe temple testifies of the empty tomb and that life beyond the veil continues for all.\nFor those who do not have an eternal companion, the ordinances powerfully confirm that every righteous person will receive every promised blessing.\nThere is sublime hope as a young couple kneels across the altar to be sealed, not just for time but for eternity.\nThere is an immensity of hope for us in the promises made to our posterity, whatever their current circumstances.\nThere is no pain, no sickness, no injustice, no suffering, nothing that can darken our hope as we believe and hold tightly to our covenants with God in the house of the Lord. It is a house of light, a house of hope.\n\n\n\nWhen Hope Is Discarded\n\nWe shed tears of sorrow as we see the sadness and despair in those who have no hope in Christ.\nI recently observed from a distance a couple who at one time had faith in Christ but then decided to discard their belief. They were successful in the world, and they found pleasure in their intellect and the rejection of their faith.\nAll seemed well until the husband, still young and energetic, suddenly fell ill and died. Like an eclipse of the sun, they had blocked the light of *the* Son, and the result was an eclipse of hope. The wife, in her disbelief, now felt disoriented, painfully unprepared, unable to comfort her children. Her intellect had told her that her life was in perfect order until suddenly she could see no tomorrow. Her despair brought darkness and confusion.\n\n\n\nHope in Heartbreaking Tragedy\n\nLet me contrast her painful despair with another family\u2019s hope in Christ during a heartbreaking time.\nTwenty-one years ago the newborn son of my nephew Ben Andersen and his wife, Robbie, was life-flighted from their Idaho farming community to Salt Lake City. I arrived at the hospital, and Ben explained the severe, life-threatening complications with their baby\u2019s heart. We placed our hands on Trey\u2019s tiny head. The Lord blessed him with continued life.\nTrey had heart surgery the first week of his life, and more surgeries followed. As the years passed, it became apparent that Trey would need a heart transplant. Although his physical activities were limited, his faith expanded. He wrote, \u201cI have never felt sorry for myself because I have always known the importance of having faith in Jesus Christ and a testimony of the plan of salvation.\u201d\n\nTrey kept on his phone this well-known quote from President Nelson: \u201cThe joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.\u201d\n\nTrey wrote: \u201cI have always looked forward to serving a full-time mission, but \u2026 my doctors won\u2019t let me serve a mission until at least a year after my transplant. \u2026 I\u2019ve put my faith in Jesus Christ.\u201d\nTrey was excited at being accepted into the accounting major at BYU beginning this semester, but even more excited in late July when he received the very anticipated telephone call to come to the hospital for his heart transplant.\n\u201cOne year,\u201d Trey said, \u201cand I will be on my mission.\u201d\nThere were great expectations as he entered the operating room. However, during the surgery there were devastating complications, and Trey never regained consciousness.\nHis mother, Robbie, said: \u201cFriday had been the most heartbreaking day \u2026 just trying to wrap our minds around it. \u2026 I had stayed up late just trying to process everything. \u2026 But Saturday, I woke up with a feeling of absolute joy. It wasn\u2019t just peace; it wasn\u2019t denial. I felt joy for my son, and I felt joy as his mother. \u2026 Ben had gotten up a lot earlier than me, and when we finally got a chance to talk, Ben had awakened with the exact same feeling.\u201d\n\nBen explained: \u201cClarity came to my soul as God taught me through His Holy Spirit. I awoke at 4:00 a.m. and was filled with indescribable peace and joy. How is this possible? \u2026 The passing of Trey is so very painful, and I miss him so much. But the Lord does not leave us comfortless. \u2026 I look forward to a joyful reunion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe Promise of Hope\n\nTrey had noted in his journal these words from President Nelson\u2019s general conference talk: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem possible to feel joy when your child suffers with an incurable illness or when you lose your job or when your spouse betrays you. Yet that is precisely the joy the Savior offers. His joy is constant, assuring us that our \u2018afflictions shall be but a small moment\u2019 [[[D&C 121|Doctrine and Covenants 121:7]]] and be consecrated to our gain.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, the peace you seek may not come as quickly as you desire, but I promise you that as you trust in the Lord, His peace will come.\nMay we nurture our precious faith, pressing forward with a perfect brightness of hope. I testify that our hope is our Savior, Jesus Christ. Through Him, all our righteous dreams will be realized. He is the God of hope\u2014the triumph of hope. He lives and He loves you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Recently my husband, Greg, received a diagnosis that would require an intensive surgery and months of chemotherapy. Like many of you who have faced a similar situation, we immediately began praying for heaven\u2019s help and God\u2019s power. The Sunday following Greg\u2019s surgery, the sacrament was delivered to our hospital room.\nOn this occasion, I was the only one taking the sacrament. One piece of bread. One cup of water. At church, my mind often focuses on the delivery system of the sacrament\u2014the preparing, the blessing, and the passing. But on that afternoon, I pondered the gift of God\u2019s power available to me through the sacred ordinance itself and the covenant promise I was making as I took that piece of bread and that cup of water. This was a time when I needed power from heaven. In the midst of great heartache, exhaustion, and uncertainty, I wondered about this gift that would allow me to draw upon the power from Him that I so desperately needed. Partaking of the sacrament would increase my companionship with the Spirit of the Lord, allowing me to draw upon the gift of God\u2019s power, including the ministering of angels and the Savior\u2019s enabling strength to overcome.\nI don\u2019t think I had ever realized with this much clarity before that it\u2019s not only who officiates in the ordinance that matters\u2014what the ordinance and our covenant promise unlock also deserves the focus of our attention. Priesthood ordinances and covenant promises allow God to sanctify us and then work wonders in our lives. But how does this happen?\nFirst, in order for an ordinance to manifest the power of God in our lives, it must be done with authority from the Son of God. The delivery system is important. The Father entrusted Jesus Christ with the keys and authority to oversee the delivery of His priesthood ordinances. Under His direction, within the order of His priesthood, the sons of God have been ordained to stand *in place of* the Son of God.\nSecond, we don\u2019t just make covenant promises\u2014we must keep them. In many gospel ordinances, we make sacred covenants with God; He promises to bless us as we *keep* those covenants. Do we realize it is the combination of priesthood ordinances along with the keeping of covenant promises that allows us to draw upon God\u2019s power?\nThat afternoon I wondered if I, a covenant daughter of God, fully understood how to access the gift of God\u2019s power through priesthood ordinances and if I truly recognized how God\u2019s power works within me.\nIn 2019 a prophetic invitation was extended to the women of the Church, teaching us how to draw the Savior\u2019s power into our lives. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson invited us to study [[D&C 25|Doctrine and Covenants 25]], a revelation given to Emma Smith in Harmony, Pennsylvania. Accepting that invitation changed my life.\nLast month I had an unexpected opportunity to visit Harmony. There, under the maple trees, the priesthood was restored to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Close to those trees is the front door of Joseph and Emma\u2019s home. Across from the fireplace in that home there is a window. I stood at that window and wondered what Emma might have thought as she looked out across the trees.\nIn July of 1830, Emma was 26 years old; *she was so young*. She was three and a half years into her marriage. She had lost a baby boy\u2014her first. His little grave is just down the lane from her home. As I stood at that window, it was not hard for me to imagine what might have filled her thoughts. Surely she worried about their finances, about the increasing persecution that threatened their safety, about their future. And yet the work of God was everywhere around her. Did she also wonder about her place in the plan, her purpose in His kingdom, and her potential in the eyes of God?\nI think she may have.\nJust across the way, the gift of God\u2019s priesthood authority and keys had been restored to the earth. This was a time when Emma actually needed power from heaven. In the midst of great heartache, exhaustion, and uncertainty, I imagine Emma wondered about this gift of God\u2019s priesthood that could unlock the power from Him that she so desperately needed.\nBut Emma didn\u2019t just stand at that window and wonder.\nWhile the Prophet Joseph was being tutored in keys, offices, ordinances, and how to assist in the service of the priesthood, the Lord Himself, through His prophet, gave a revelation to Emma. Not Nauvoo-Relief-Society-president Emma\u2014this revelation was given to 26-year-old Emma in Harmony. Through revelation, Emma would learn about the inward sanctification and covenant connection that would increase the ability of those priesthood ordinances to work in her life.\nFirst, the Lord reminded Emma of her place in His plan, including who she was and whose she was\u2014a daughter in His kingdom. She was invited to \u201cwalk in the paths of virtue,\u201d a path that included ordinances that would unlock God\u2019s power if Emma held on to her covenants.\nSecond, in her season of deep mourning, the Lord gave her purpose. Emma didn\u2019t just have a front-row seat to the Restoration; she was an essential participant in the work taking place. She would be set apart \u201cto expound scriptures, and to exhort the church.\u201d Her time would \u201cbe given to writing, and to learning much.\u201d Emma was given a sacred role to help prepare the Saints to worship; their songs unto the Lord would be received as prayers and \u201canswered with a blessing upon their heads.\u201d\nLast, the Lord outlined a process of inward sanctification that would prepare Emma for exaltation. \u201cExcept thou do this,\u201d the Lord explained to her, \u201cwhere I am you cannot come.\u201d\nIf we read [[D&C 25|section 25]] carefully, we discover an important progression taking place. Emma would go from being a daughter in the kingdom to \u201celect lady\u201d to queen. Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood ordinances, combined with the keeping of her covenant promises, would increase her companionship with the Spirit and with angels, empowering her to navigate her life with divine guidance. Through His divine power, God would heal her heart, enlarge her capacity, and transform her into the version of herself He knew she could become. And through the ordinances of the Melchizedek Priesthood, \u201cthe power of godliness [would be] manifest\u201d in her life, and the Lord would part the veil so she could receive understanding from Him. *This* is what it looks like for God\u2019s power to work within us.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught:\n\u201c*Everything* that happened in [Harmony] has profound implications for *your* lives. The restoration of the priesthood, along with the Lord\u2019s counsel to Emma, can guide and bless each of you.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;Accessing the power of God in your life requires the same things that the Lord instructed Emma and each of [us] to do.\u201d\nThere were important things happening on both sides of that window in Harmony, including the revelation given to the elect lady whom the Lord had called\u2014a revelation that would strengthen, encourage, and instruct Emma Smith, God\u2019s daughter.\nWhen our granddaughter Isabelle was given a name and a blessing, her father blessed her with an understanding of the priesthood; that she would continue to grow in and learn about the blessing it would provide in her life; and that her faith in the priesthood would grow as she continued to grow in understanding.\nIt is not often a little girl is blessed to understand the priesthood and to learn how those priesthood ordinances and covenant promises will help her to access God\u2019s power. But I remembered Emma and thought to myself, Why not? This tiny daughter has the potential to become an elect lady in His kingdom and eventually a queen. Through His priesthood ordinances and the keeping of her covenant promises, God\u2019s power will work in and through her to help her overcome whatever life brings and become the woman God knows she can become. This is something I want each girl in the kingdom to understand.\n\u201cLive up to your privileges.\u201d\nLearn how priesthood ordinances and covenant promises will allow God\u2019s power to flow into your life with greater efficacy, working in and through you, empowering and equipping you to reach your full purpose and potential.\nCarefully study and ponder the Aaronic and the Melchizedek Priesthood ordinances, the covenant promises we make with each, and the power of God we access through those ordinances.\nRemember, it\u2019s not only who officiates in the ordinance that matters; what the ordinance and your covenant promise unlock also deserves the focus of your attention.\nPartaking of the bread and water is a weekly reminder of His power working in you to help you overcome. Wearing the garment of the holy priesthood is a daily reminder of the gift of His power working in you to help you become.\nWe all have access to the gift of God\u2019s power.\nEvery time we partake of the sacrament.\nEvery time we cross the threshold of a temple.\nThis is the highlight of my Sabbath. This is why I cherish my temple recommend.\n\u201cIn the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.\u201d\nOf this gift I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Before I begin, I should tell you that two of my children have passed out whilst speaking at pulpits, and I have never felt more connected to them than in this moment. I\u2019ve got more on my mind than just the trapdoor.\nOur family has six children, who sometimes tease one another that they are the favourite child. Each has different reasons for being preferred. Our love for each of our children is pure and fulfilling and complete. We could not love any one of them any more than another\u2014with each child\u2019s birth came the most beautiful expansion of our love. I most relate to my Heavenly Father\u2019s love for me through the love that I feel for my children.\nAs they each rehearse their claims to be the most loved child, you might have thought that our family had never had an untidy bedroom. The sense of blemishes in the relationship between parent and child is diminished with a focus on love.\nAt some point, perhaps because I can see that we are heading toward an inevitable family riot, I\u2019ll say something like, \u201cOK, you have worn me down, but I am not going to announce it; you know which one of you is my favourite.\u201d My goal is that each one of the six feels victorious and all-out war is avoided\u2014at least until next time!\nIn his Gospel, John describes himself as \u201cthe disciple whom Jesus loved,\u201d as if that arrangement were somehow unique. I like to think that this was because John felt so completely loved by Jesus. Nephi gave me a similar sense when he wrote, \u201cI glory in *my* Jesus.\u201d Of course, the Saviour isn\u2019t Nephi\u2019s any more than He is John\u2019s, and yet the personal nature of Nephi\u2019s relationship with \u201chis\u201d Jesus led him to that tender description.\nIsn\u2019t it wonderful that there are times when we can feel so fully and personally noticed and loved? Nephi can call Him \u201chis\u201d Jesus, and so can we. Our Saviour\u2019s love is the \u201chighest, noblest, strongest kind of love,\u201d and He provides until we are \u201cfilled.\u201d Divine love never runs dry, and we are each a cherished favourite. God\u2019s love is where, as circles on a Venn diagram, we all overlap. Whichever parts of us seem different, His love is where we find togetherness.\nIs it any surprise that the greatest commandments are to love God and to love those around us? When I see people showing Christlike love for one another, it feels to me as if that love contains more than just *their* love; it is love that also has divinity in it. When we love one another in this way, as completely and fully as we can, heaven gets involved too.\nSo if someone we care about seems distant from a sense of divine love, we can follow this pattern\u2014by doing things that bring us closer to God ourselves and then doing things that bring us closer to them\u2014an unspoken beckoning to come to Christ.\nI wish I could sit down with you and ask you what circumstances cause you to feel God\u2019s love. Which verses of scripture, which particular acts of service? Where would you be? What music? In whose company? General conference is a rich place to learn about connecting with heaven\u2019s love.\nBut perhaps you feel a long way from the love of God. Maybe there is a chorus of voices of discouragement and darkness that weighs into your thoughts, messages telling you that you are too wounded and confused, too weak and overlooked, too different or disoriented to warrant heavenly love in any real way. If you hear those ideas, then please hear this: those voices are just wrong. We can confidently disregard brokenness in any way disqualifying us from heavenly love\u2014every time we sing the hymn that reminds us that our beloved and flawless Saviour chose to be \u201cbruised, broken, [and] torn for us,\u201d every time we take broken bread. Surely Jesus removes all shame from the broken. Through His brokenness, He became perfect, and He can make us perfect in spite of our brokenness. Broken, lonely, torn, and bruised He was\u2014and we may feel we are\u2014but separated from the love of God we are not. \u201cBroken people, perfect love,\u201d as the song goes.\nYou might know something secret about yourself that makes you feel unlovable. However right you might be about what you know about yourself, you are wrong to think that you have put yourself beyond the reach of God\u2019s love. We are sometimes cruel and impatient toward ourselves in ways that we could never imagine being toward anyone else. There is much for us to do in this life, but self-loathing and shameful self-condemnation are not on that list. However misshapen *we* might feel *we* are, *His* arms are not shortened. No. They are always long enough to \u201c[reach our] reaching\u201d and embrace each one of us.\nWhen we don\u2019t feel the warmth of divine love, it hasn\u2019t gone away. God\u2019s own words are that \u201cthe mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but [His] kindness shall not depart from [us].\u201d So, just to be clear, the idea that God has stopped loving should be so far down the list of possible explanations in life that we don\u2019t get to it until after the mountains have left and the hills are gone!\nI really enjoy this symbolism of mountains being evidence of the certainty of God\u2019s love. That powerful symbolism weaves into accounts of those who go to the mountains to receive revelation and Isaiah\u2019s description of \u201cthe mountain of the Lord\u2019s house\u201d being \u201cestablished in the top of the mountains.\u201d The house of the Lord is the home of our most precious covenants and a place for us all to retreat and sink deeply into the evidence of our Father\u2019s love for us. I have also enjoyed the comfort that comes to my soul when I wrap myself more tightly in my baptismal covenant and find someone who is mourning a loss or grieving a disappointment and I try to help them hold and process their feelings. Are these ways that we can become more immersed in the precious covenantal love *hesed*?\nSo if God\u2019s love does not leave us, why don\u2019t we always feel it? Just to manage your expectations: I don\u2019t know. But *being* loved is definitely not the same as *feeling* loved, and I have a few thoughts that might help you as you pursue your answers to that question.\nPerhaps you are wrestling with grief, depression, betrayal, loneliness, disappointment, or other powerful intrusion into your ability to feel God\u2019s love for you. If so, these things can dull or suspend our ability to feel as we might otherwise feel. For a season at least, perhaps you will not be able to *feel* His love, and knowledge will have to suffice. But I wonder if you could experiment\u2014patiently\u2014with different ways of expressing and receiving divine love. Can you take a step back from whatever is in front of you and maybe another step and another, until you see a wider landscape, wider and wider still if necessary, until you are literally \u201cthinking celestial\u201d because you are looking at the stars and remembering worlds without number and through them their Creator?\nBirdsong, feeling the sun or a breeze or rain on my skin, and times when nature puts my senses in awe of God\u2014each has had a part in providing me with heavenly connection. Perhaps the comfort of faithful friends will help. Maybe music? Or serving? Have you kept a record or journal of times when your connection with God was clearer to you? Perhaps you could invite those you trust to share their sources of divine connection with you as you search for relief and understanding.\nI wonder, if Jesus were to choose a place where you and He could meet, a private place where you would be able to have a singular focus on Him, might He choose your unique place of personal suffering, the place of your deepest need, where no one else can go? Somewhere you feel so lonely that you must truly be all alone but you aren\u2019t quite, a place to which perhaps only He has travelled but actually has already prepared to meet you there when you arrive? If you are waiting for Him to come, might He already be there and within reach?\nIf you do feel filled with love in this season of your life, please try and hold on to it as effectively as a sieve holds water. Splash it everywhere you go. One of the miracles of the divine economy is that when we try to share Jesus\u2019s love, we find ourselves being filled up in a variation of the principle that \u201cwhosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.\u201d\nBeing filled with God\u2019s love shields us in life\u2019s storms but also makes the happy moments happier\u2014our joyful days, when there is sunshine in the sky, are made even brighter by the sunshine in our souls.\nLet\u2019s become \u201crooted and grounded\u201d in our Jesus and in His love. Let\u2019s look for and treasure experiences of feeling His love and power in our lives. The joy of the gospel is available to all: not just the happy, not just the downcast. Joy is our purpose, not the gift of our circumstances. We have every good reason to \u201crejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men.\u201d Let\u2019s get full. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "For centuries, black powder was the most powerful explosive available. It could launch cannon balls, but it wasn\u2019t effective for most mining and road construction projects. It was just too weak to shatter rock.\nIn 1846 an Italian chemist named Ascanio Sobrero synthesized a new explosive, nitroglycerin. This oily fluid was at least a thousand times more powerful than black powder. It could easily shatter rock. Unfortunately, nitroglycerin was unstable. If you dropped it from a small height, it\u2019d blow up. If it got too hot, it\u2019d blow up. If it got too cold, it\u2019d blow up. Even placed in a cool, dark room and left alone, it\u2019d eventually blow up. Most countries banned its transportation, and many banned its manufacture.\nIn 1860 a Swedish scientist named Alfred Nobel began trying to stabilize nitroglycerin. After seven years of experimentation, he achieved his goal by absorbing nitroglycerin into a nearly worthless substance known as diatomaceous earth, or kieselguhr. Kieselguhr is a porous rock that can be crumbled into a fine powder. When mixed with nitroglycerin, kieselguhr absorbs the nitroglycerin, and the resultant paste can be shaped into \u201csticks.\u201d In this form, nitroglycerin was much more stable. It could be safely stored, transported, and used with undiminished explosive power. Nobel named the combination of nitroglycerin and kieselguhr \u201cdynamite.\u201d\nDynamite changed the world. It also made Nobel wealthy. Without a stabilizer, nitroglycerin was just too hazardous to be commercially valuable, as Ascanio Sobrero found out. By itself, as I mentioned, kieselguhr was of little value. But the combination of the two components made dynamite transformative and precious.\nIn a similar way, the combination of the gospel of Jesus Christ and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints provides powerful and transformative benefits for us. The gospel is perfect, but a divinely commissioned church is required to preach it, maintain its purity, and administer its sacred ordinances with the Savior\u2019s power and authority.\nConsider the combination of the Savior\u2019s gospel and His Church as established by the Book of Mormon prophet Alma. The Church was responsible for preaching \u201cnothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who [would redeem] his people.\u201d Using God\u2019s authority, the Church was responsible for administering the ordinance of baptism \u201cin the name of the Lord, as a witness [of entering] into a covenant with him [to] serve him and keep his commandments.\u201d The people who were baptized took on themselves the name of Jesus Christ, joined His Church, and were promised great power through an outpouring of the Spirit.\nPeople flocked to the Waters of Mormon to hear Alma preach the gospel. Though they revered those waters and the surrounding forests, the Lord\u2019s Church was not a location or a building, nor is it today. The Church is simply ordinary people, disciples of Jesus Christ, gathered and organized into a divinely appointed structure that helps the Lord accomplish His purposes. The Church is the instrument through which we learn the central role of Jesus Christ in Heavenly Father\u2019s plan. The Church offers the authoritative way for individuals to participate in ordinances and make lasting covenants with God. Keeping those covenants draws us closer to God, gives us access to His power, and transforms us into who He intends us to become.\nJust as dynamite without nitroglycerin is unremarkable, the Savior\u2019s Church is special only if it is built on His gospel. Without the Savior\u2019s gospel and the authority to administer the ordinances thereof, the Church isn\u2019t exceptional.\nWithout the stabilizing effect of kieselguhr, nitroglycerin had limited value as an explosive. As history has shown, without the Lord\u2019s Church, humanity\u2019s understanding of His gospel was likewise unstable\u2014prone to doctrinal drift and subject to the influence of different religions, cultures, and philosophies. An amalgamation of those influences has been manifested in every dispensation leading up to this last one. Though the gospel was initially revealed in its purity, the interpretation and application of that gospel gradually took on a form of godliness that lacked power because the divinely authorized framework was absent.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints enables access to God\u2019s power because it is authorized by Him both to teach the doctrine of Christ and to offer the gospel\u2019s saving and exalting ordinances. The Savior yearns to forgive our sins, help us access His power, and transform us. He suffered for our sins and longs to pardon us from the punishment that we otherwise would deserve. He wants us to become holy and be perfected in Him.\nJesus Christ has the power to do this. He didn\u2019t simply sympathize with our imperfections and lament our eternal condemnation in consequence of sin. No, He went beyond that, infinitely beyond that, and restored His Church to enable access to His power.\nThe core of the gospel that the Church teaches is that Jesus Christ bore \u201cour griefs, and carried our sorrows.\u201d He had \u201claid on him the iniquity of us all.\u201d He \u201cendured the cross,\u201d broke \u201cthe bands of death,\u201d \u201cascended into heaven, and \u2026 sat down on the right hand of God, to claim of the Father his rights of mercy.\u201d The Savior did all this because He loves His Father and He loves us. He has already paid the infinite price so He can \u201c[claim] all those who have faith in him [and advocate]\u201d for them\u2014for us. Jesus Christ wants nothing more than for us to repent and come unto Him so that He can justify and sanctify us. In this desire, He is relentless and unwavering.\nThe access to God\u2019s covenantal power and His covenantal love is through His Church. The combination of the Savior\u2019s gospel and His Church transforms our lives. It transformed my maternal grandparents. My grandfather Oskar Andersson worked in a shipyard on H\u00f6gmars\u00f6, an island in the Stockholm archipelago. His wife, Albertina, and their children lived on the Swedish mainland. Once every two weeks, on Saturday, Oskar rowed his boat home for the weekend before returning to H\u00f6gmars\u00f6 on Sunday evening. One day, while on H\u00f6gmars\u00f6, he heard two American missionaries preach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Oskar felt that what he heard was pure truth, and he was filled with unspeakable joy.\nThe next time he returned home, Oskar excitedly told Albertina all about the missionaries. He explained that he believed what they taught. He asked her to read the pamphlets they had given him, and he told her that he didn\u2019t think that any of their future children should be baptized as infants. Albertina was furious and threw the pamphlets on the rubbish heap. Not much was said between them before Oskar returned to work on Sunday evening.\nAs soon as he was gone, Albertina retrieved those pamphlets. She carefully compared their doctrine with the teachings in her well-worn Bible. She was astonished to feel that what she read was true. The next time Oskar returned home, he received a warm welcome, as did the copy of the Book of Mormon he brought with him. Albertina eagerly read, again comparing the doctrine to that in her Bible. Like Oskar, she recognized pure truth and was filled with unspeakable joy.\nOskar, Albertina, and their children moved to H\u00f6gmars\u00f6 to be close to the few Church members there. A week after Oskar and Albertina were baptized in 1916, Oskar was called to be the group leader on H\u00f6gmars\u00f6. Like many converts, Oskar and Albertina faced criticism because of their new faith. Local farmers refused to sell them milk, so Oskar rowed across the fjord every day to purchase milk from a more tolerant farmer.\nYet during the ensuing years, Church membership on H\u00f6gmars\u00f6 increased, in part because of Albertina\u2019s powerful testimony and burning missionary zeal. When the group became a branch, Oskar was called as the branch president.\nMembers of that H\u00f6gmars\u00f6 branch revered that island. This was their Waters of Mormon. This was where they came to a knowledge of their Redeemer.\nOver the years, as they kept their baptismal covenant, Oskar and Albertina were transformed by the power of Jesus Christ. They longed to make more covenants and receive their temple blessings. To obtain those blessings, they permanently emigrated from their home in Sweden to Salt Lake City in 1949. Oskar had served as the leader of the members on H\u00f6gmars\u00f6 for 33&nbsp;years.\nThe combination of nitroglycerin and kieselguhr made dynamite valuable; the combination of the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church is beyond price. Oskar and Albertina heard about the restored gospel because a prophet of God had called, assigned, and sent missionaries to Sweden. By divine commission, missionaries taught the doctrine of Christ and by priesthood authority baptized Oskar and Albertina. As members, Oskar and Albertina continued learning, developing, and serving others. They became Latter-day Saints because they kept the covenants they made.\nThe Savior refers to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as \u201cmy church\u201d because He commissioned it to accomplish His purposes\u2014preaching His gospel, offering His ordinances and covenants, and making it possible for His power to justify and sanctify us. Without His Church, there is no authority, no preaching of revealed truths in His name, no ordinances or covenants, no manifestation of the power of godliness, no transformation into who God wants us to become, and God\u2019s plan for His children is set at naught. The Church in this dispensation is integral to His plan.\nI invite you to commit yourself more fully to the Savior, His gospel, and His Church. As you do so, you will find that the combination of the Savior\u2019s gospel and His Church brings power into your life. This power is far greater than dynamite. It\u2019ll shatter the rocks in your way, transform you into an inheritor in God\u2019s kingdom. And you will be \u201cfilled with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "On June&nbsp;1, 1843, Addison Pratt left Nauvoo, Illinois, to preach the gospel in the Hawaiian Islands, leaving his wife, Louisa Barnes Pratt, to care for their young family.\nIn Nauvoo, as persecutions intensified, forcing the Saints to leave, and later at Winter Quarters as they prepared to migrate to the Salt Lake Valley, Louisa faced the decision of whether to make the journey. It would have been easier to stay and to wait for Addison to return than to travel alone.\nOn both occasions, she sought guidance from the prophet, Brigham Young, who encouraged her to go. Despite the great difficulty and her personal reluctance, she successfully made the journey each time.\nInitially, Louisa found little joy in traveling. However, she soon began to welcome the green prairie grass, colorful wildflowers, and patches of ground along the riverbanks. \u201cThe gloom on my mind wore gradually away,\u201d she recorded, \u201cand there was not a more mirthful woman in the whole company.\u201d\nLouisa\u2019s story has deeply inspired me. I admire her willingness to set aside her personal preferences, her ability to trust God, and how exercising her faith helped her to see the situation differently.\nShe has reminded me that we have a loving Father in Heaven, who cares for us wherever we are, and that we can trust Him more than anyone or anything else.\n\n\nThe Source of Truth\n\nGod trusts us to make many important decisions, and in all matters He asks us to trust Him. This is especially difficult when our judgment or public opinion differs from His will for His children.\nSome suggest that we should redraw the lines between what is right and what is wrong because they say that truth is relative, reality is self-defined, or God is so generous that He does not actually care about what we do.\nAs we seek to understand and accept God\u2019s will, it is helpful to remember that the boundaries between right and wrong are not for us to define. God has established these boundaries Himself, based on eternal truths for our benefit and blessing.\nThe desire to change God\u2019s eternal truth has a long history. It started before the world began, when Satan rebelled against God\u2019s plan, seeking selfishly to destroy human agency. Following this pattern, people like Sherem, Nehor, and Korihor have argued that faith is foolish, revelation is irrelevant, and whatever we want to do is right. Sadly, so very often these deviations from God\u2019s truth have led to great sorrow.\nWhile some things may depend on context, not everything does. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has consistently taught that God\u2019s saving truths are absolute, independent, and defined by God Himself.\n\n\n\nOur Choice\n\nWhom we choose to trust is one of life\u2019s important decisions. King Benjamin instructed his people, \u201cBelieve in God; believe that he is \u2026&nbsp;; believe that he has all wisdom \u2026&nbsp;; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.\u201d\nFortunately, we have the scriptures and guidance from living prophets to help us understand God\u2019s truth. If clarification beyond what we have is needed, God provides it through His prophets. And He will respond to our sincere prayers through the Holy Ghost as we seek to understand truths we do not yet fully appreciate.\nElder Neil&nbsp;L. Andersen once taught that we should not be surprised \u201cif at times [our] personal views are not initially in harmony with the teachings of the Lord\u2019s prophet. These are moments of learning,\u201d he said, \u201cof humility, when we go to our knees in prayer. We walk forward in faith, trusting in God, knowing that with time we will receive more spiritual clarity from our Heavenly Father.\u201d\nAt all times, it is helpful to remember Alma\u2019s teaching that God gives His word according to the attention and effort we devote to it. If we heed God\u2019s word, we will receive more; if we ignore His counsel, we will receive less and less until we have none. This loss of knowledge does not mean that the truth was wrong; rather, it shows that we have lost the capacity to understand it.\n\n\n\nLook to the Savior\n\nIn Capernaum, the Savior taught about His identity and mission. Many found His words difficult to hear, leading them to turn their backs and \u201c[walk] no more with him.\u201d\nWhy did they walk away?\nBecause they did not like what He said. So, trusting their own judgment, they walked away, denying themselves blessings that would have come had they stayed.\nIt is easy for our pride to come between us and eternal truth. When we don\u2019t understand, we can pause, let our feelings settle, and then choose how to respond. The Savior urged us to \u201clook unto [Him] in every thought; doubt not, fear not.\u201d When we focus on the Savior, our faith can start to overcome our concerns.\nAs President Dieter&nbsp;F. Uchtdorf encouraged us to do: \u201cPlease, first doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith. We must never allow doubt to hold us prisoner and keep us from the divine love, peace, and gifts that come through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlessings Come to Those Who Stay\n\nAs the disciples walked away from the Savior that day, He then asked the Twelve, \u201cWill ye also go away?\u201d\nPeter answered:\n\u201cLord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.\n\u201cAnd we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d\nNow, the Apostles lived in the same world, and they faced the same social pressures as the disciples who walked away. However, in this moment, they chose their faith and trusted God, thus preserving blessings God gives to those who stay.\nPerhaps you, like me, sometimes find yourself on both sides of this decision. When we find it difficult to understand or embrace God\u2019s will, it is comforting to remember that He loves us as we are, wherever we are. And He has something better for us. If we reach out to Him, He will assist us.\nWhile reaching out to Him can be difficult, just as the father who sought healing for his son was told by the Savior, \u201cAll things are possible to him that believeth.\u201d In our moments of struggle, we too can cry out, \u201cHelp thou [my] unbelief.\u201d\n\n\n\nSubmitting Our Will to His\n\nElder Neal&nbsp;A. Maxwell once taught that \u201cthe submission of one\u2019s will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God\u2019s altar.\u201d No wonder King Benjamin was so eager that his people become \u201cas a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.\u201d\nAs always, the Savior set the perfect example for us. With a heavy heart, and knowing the painful work He had to do, He submitted to His Father\u2019s will, fulfilling His messianic mission and opening the promise of eternity to you and me.\nThe choice to submit our will to God\u2019s is an act of faith that lies at the heart of our discipleship. In making that choice, we discover that our agency is not diminished; rather, it is magnified and rewarded by the presence of the Holy Ghost, who brings purpose, joy, peace, and hope we can find nowhere else.\nSeveral months ago, a stake president and I visited a sister in his stake and her young adult son. After years away from the Church, wandering difficult and unfriendly paths, she had returned. During our visit, we asked her why she had come back.\n\u201cI had made a mess of my life,\u201d she said, \u201cand I knew where I needed to be.\u201d\nI then asked her what she had learned in her journey.\nWith some emotion, she shared that she had learned that she needed to attend church long enough to break the habit of not coming and that she needed to stay until it was where she wanted to be. Her return was not easy, but as she exercised faith in the Father\u2019s plan, she felt the Spirit return.\nAnd then she added, \u201cI have learned for myself that God is good and that His ways are better than mine.\u201d\nI bear witness of God, our Eternal Father, who loves us; of His Son, Jesus Christ, who saved us. They know our hurts and challenges. They will never forsake us and know perfectly how to succor us. We can be of good cheer as we trust Them more than anyone or anything else. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Nelson taught, \u201cOur Heavenly Father has reserved many of His most noble spirits\u2014perhaps \u2026 His finest team\ufeff\u2014for this final phase.\u201d Because we have been reserved for these latter days, it is crucial for us to learn to be disciples of Jesus Christ.\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is the Good Shepherd, and He knows His flock, and the flock knows its Shepherd because \u201che calleth his own sheep by name.\u201d He is always calling upon us, and He uses us, His ordinary servants, to help bring His children to Him.\nA while ago, a stake president and I were visiting members of the Church in a local neighborhood. After we finished our scheduled visits, the stake president asked me if we could go see one more family. He felt impressed that we should talk with them.\nWe knocked on the door, and a sister opened it. She looked at me, but she didn\u2019t know who I was, so she didn\u2019t express much. I pointed my hand toward the stake president, who greeted her by name. As soon as she heard and saw him, she rejoiced. Standing there at the door, they both hugged each other and cried together. This set the tone for our visit. We didn\u2019t know that the sister had received chemotherapy the day before. She felt too weak to care for her adult son. So I helped the stake president dress her son, and we put him in his wheelchair. We fed him the food that another sweet sister from the ward had brought earlier, and we helped with other tasks. Before we left their home, we were able to bless them.\nAll that was going through my mind during this visit was a confirmation that Jesus Christ loves them deeply. He understands them and personally knows the pain of their unique situation. Almost the entire visit happened in silence. On this occasion we did not give a big sermon or share our favorite scripture, but the Lord blessed us with His Spirit abundantly.\nOne of the greatest reasons your Heavenly Father sent you here at this time is so that you can realize your full potential. Preach My Gospel teaches us that as disciples of Christ, we should avoid comparing ourselves to one another. Your spiritual abilities are unique, personal, and innate, and your Heavenly Father wants to help you develop them. There will always be someone you can help feel the love of your Heavenly Father. Your potential is divine. While it\u2019s certainly important to prepare yourself to succeed in this very competitive world, one of your crucial missions throughout your life is to become a disciple of Jesus Christ and to follow the impressions of the Spirit. As you do this, God will bless your life; He will bless your current or future family; and He will bless the lives of His children who you encounter.\nWe live in a time of great opportunity. Although we face many difficulties, I know they are there in part to allow us to help others feel the love of our Heavenly Father. President Nelson taught, \u201cIn coming days, we will see the *greatest* manifestations of the Savior\u2019s power that the world has *ever* seen.\u201d We have the privilege to watch over people who need a helping hand, an embrace, a feeling of comfort, or for us simply to be with them in silence. If we can help lighten their burdens, even if only for a moment, then we will be able to see the great manifestations of the Savior\u2019s power in their lives.\nAs disciples of Jesus Christ, Latter-day Saints can make a positive difference in the world. We can provide a sense of joy that is reflected in our countenance\u2014a joy that we share with words of love and acts of kindness. Let us be good neighbors, good employers, good workers. Let us strive to be good Christians at all times.\nThe Lord has restored His gospel with the necessary ordinances so that Heavenly Father\u2019s children can have all the promises that bind us to Him. By helping our sisters and brothers in their daily challenges, let us also remember to help them make and keep these sacred promises with their Heavenly Father so that He in turn can promise them the richest blessings for this life and for eternity. These promises are only made possible through the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and His priesthood keys.\nIn other words, we can help others stay on the covenant path. Some of us deviate from the path from time to time, and so we must remember that for our Heavenly Father we always have the possibility of returning. Even if our course is not the most perfect, the Savior always reminds us, \u201cAs oft as [we repent] and [seek] forgiveness, with real intent, [we will be] forgiven.\u201d\nOne of the crafts of the adversary today is to make us think and believe that there is no way for us to change or that we no longer have hope. This destructive thinking causes many of us to stop trying. And it is at this moment when our love, our words of encouragement and support, our time, and our help can give someone hope enough to try once more.\nMaybe you are thinking, \u201cOK, but who ministers to me?\u201d By going and blessing the lives of our brothers and sisters, we will collect testimonies that will fill our lives with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. These testimonies will revitalize us to try once more ourselves. The Holy Spirit will revive us and help us with renewed testimonies to continue with our own difficulties and personal trials. Whenever we seek to bless the lives of others, the Lord takes mercy upon us even more; He strengthens us and helps us in our lives.\nPlease remember that the Lord Jesus Christ is your Savior and understands you personally. He knows what it is to have to fulfill a calling and leave things behind to help the children of God. He has the power to bless you in everything if you believe in Him and do not doubt.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, on that day when a priesthood leader felt impressed for us to visit a mother and a son that we did not have on our agenda, I proclaim that God knew they needed us. And at the end, I was the one who was ministered to. On that day, I received one of the greatest lessons of the Savior\u2019s love for us.\nI testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that He lives, that He lived and died for you and me, and that He was resurrected for you and me so that we can aspire to celestial reunions full of joy with those who are already on the other side of the veil. I know that He understands you and me perfectly. He understands each of our difficult moments, and He has the power to help us in those moments when we feel most vulnerable. I know that the Lord Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father appeared to Joseph Smith to restore the gospel in these days. I know that our dear prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, is a prophet of the Lord, and I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "This year millions have been inspired by the gospel study plan known by the Savior\u2019s invitation \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d Following Christ is not a casual or occasional practice. It is a continuous commitment and way of life that should guide us at all times and in all places. His teachings and His example define the path for every disciple of Jesus Christ. And all are invited to this path, for He invites all to come unto Him, \u201cblack and white, bond and free, male and female; \u2026 and all are alike unto God.\u201d\n\n\nI.\n\nThe first step in following Christ is to obey what He defined as \u201cthe great commandment in the law\u201d:\n\u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\n\u201cThis is the first and great commandment.\n\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n\u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d\n\n\nThe commandments of God provide the guiding and steadying force in our lives. Our experiences in mortality are like the little boy and his father flying a kite on a windy day. As the kite rose higher, the winds caused it to tug on the connecting string in the little boy\u2019s hand. Inexperienced with the force of mortal winds, he proposed to cut the string so the kite could rise higher. His wise father counseled no, explaining that the string is what holds the kite in place against mortal winds. If we lose our hold on the string, the kite will not rise higher. It will be carried about by these winds and inevitably crash to the earth.\nThat essential string represents the covenants that connect us to God, our Heavenly Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ. As we honor those covenants by keeping Their commandments and following Their plan of redemption, Their promised blessings enable us to soar to celestial heights.\nThe Book of Mormon frequently declares that Christ is \u201cthe light of the world.\u201d During His appearance to the Nephites, the risen Lord explained that teaching by telling them: \u201cI have set an example for you.\u201d \u201cI am the light which ye shall hold up\u2014that which ye have seen me do.\u201d He is our role model. We learn what He has said and done by studying the scriptures and following prophetic teachings, as President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has urged us to do. In the ordinance of the sacrament, we covenant each Sabbath day that we will \u201calways remember him and keep his commandments.\u201d\n\n\n\nII.\n\nIn the Book of Mormon, the Lord gave us the fundamentals in what He called \u201cthe doctrine of Christ.\u201d These are faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, enduring to the end, and becoming as a little child, which means to trust the Lord and submit to all He requires of us.\nThe Lord\u2019s commandments are of two types: permanent, like the doctrine of Christ, and temporary. Temporary commandments are those necessary for the needs of the Lord\u2019s Church or the faithful in temporary circumstances, but to be set aside when the need has passed. An example of temporary commandments are the Lord\u2019s directions to the early leadership of the Church to move the Saints from New York to Ohio, to Missouri, and to Illinois and finally to lead the pioneer exodus to the Intermountain West. Though only temporary, when still in force these commandments were given to be obeyed.\nSome permanent commandments have taken considerable time to be generally observed. For example, President Lorenzo Snow\u2019s famous sermon on the law of tithing emphasized a commandment given earlier but not yet generally observed by Church members. It needed reemphasis in the circumstances then faced by the Church and its members. Recent examples of reemphases have also been needed because of current circumstances faced by Latter-day Saints or the Church. These include the proclamation on the family, issued by President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley a generation ago, and President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson\u2019s recent call for the Church to be known by its revealed name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nAnother of our Savior\u2019s teachings seems to require reemphasis in the circumstances of our day.\nThis is a time of many harsh and hurtful words in public communications and sometimes even in our families. Sharp differences on issues of public policy often result in actions of hostility\u2014even hatred\u2014in public and personal relationships. This atmosphere of enmity sometimes even paralyzes capacities for lawmaking on matters of importance where most citizens see an urgent need for some action in the public interest.\nWhat should followers of Christ teach and do in this time of toxic communications? What were His teachings and examples?\n\nIt is significant that among the first principles Jesus taught when He appeared to the Nephites was to avoid contention. While He taught this in the context of disputes over religious doctrine, the reasons He gave clearly apply to communications and relationships in politics, public policy, and family relationships. Jesus taught:\n\u201cHe that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.\n\u201cBehold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.\u201d\nIn His remaining ministry among the Nephites, Jesus taught other commandments closely related to His prohibition of contention. We know from the Bible that He had previously taught each of these in His great Sermon on the Mount, usually in precisely the same language He later used with the Nephites. I will quote the familiar Bible language:\n\n\u201cLove your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\u201d\nThis is one of Christ\u2019s best-known commandments\u2014most revolutionary and most difficult to follow. Yet it is a most fundamental part of His invitation for all to follow Him. As President David&nbsp;O. McKay taught, \u201cThere is no better way to manifest love for God than to show an unselfish love for one\u2019s fellowmen.\u201d\n\nHere is another fundamental teaching by Him who is our role model: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\u201d\nPeacemakers! How it would change personal relationships if followers of Christ would forgo harsh and hurtful words in all their communications.\nIn general conference last year, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson gave us these challenges:\n\u201cOne of the easiest ways to identify a *true follower* of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people. \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 True disciples of Jesus Christ are peacemakers.\n\u201c\u2026 One of the best ways we can honor the Savior is to become a peacemaker.\u201d\nConcluding his teachings: \u201cContention is a choice. Peacemaking is a choice. You have your agency to choose contention or reconciliation. I urge you to *choose* to be a peacemaker, now and always.\u201d\nPotential adversaries should begin their discussions by identifying common ground on which all agree.\nTo follow our Perfect Role Model and His prophet, we need to practice what is popularly known as the Golden Rule: \u201cAll things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\u201d We need to love and do good to all. We need to avoid contention and be peacemakers in all our communications. This does not mean to compromise our principles and priorities but to cease harshly attacking others for theirs. That is what our Perfect Role Model did in His ministry. That is the example He set for us as He invited us to follow Him.\nIn this conference four years ago, President Nelson gave us a prophetic challenge for our own day:\n\u201cAre *you* willing to let God prevail in your life? Are *you* willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants to influence what you do each day? Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other?\u201d\n\nAs followers of Christ, we teach and testify of Jesus Christ, our Perfect Role Model. So let us follow Him by forgoing contention. As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for His blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers. In our families and other personal relationships, let us avoid what is harsh and hateful. Let us seek to be holy, like our Savior, in whose holy name I testify and invoke His blessing to help us be Saints. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Unsuccessful efforts had been made over many generations to bring the Lamanite people to a belief in the doctrine of Christ. This time, however, through the miraculous interventions of the Holy Spirit, thousands of the Lamanites were converted and became disciples of Jesus Christ.\nWe read, \u201cAnd as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in them\u2014yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away.\u201d\nThe key to the enduring conversion of this people is stated in the next verse: \u201cFor they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against any of their brethren.\u201d\nThis reference to \u201cweapons of rebellion\u201d was both literal and figurative. It meant their swords and other weapons of war but also their disobedience to God and His commandments.\nThe king of these converted Lamanites expressed it this way: \u201cAnd now behold, my brethren, \u2026 it has been all that we could do \u2026 to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God *to take them away from our hearts*, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would *take away our stain*.\u201d\nNote the king\u2019s words\u2014not only had their sincere repentance led to forgiveness of their sins, but God also took away the stain of those sins and even the desire to sin from their hearts. As you know, rather than risk any possible return to their prior state of rebellion against God, they buried their swords. And as they buried their physical weapons, with changed hearts, they also buried their disposition to sin.\nWe might ask ourselves what we could do to follow this pattern, to \u201clay down the weapons of [our] rebellion,\u201d whatever they may be, and become so \u201cconverted [to] the Lord\u201d that the stain of sin and the desire for sin are taken from our hearts and we never will fall away.\nRebellion can be active or passive. The classic example of willful rebellion is Lucifer, who, in the premortal world, opposed the Father\u2019s plan of redemption and rallied others to oppose it as well, \u201cand, at that day, many followed after him.\u201d It is not hard to discern the impact of his continuing rebellion in our own time.\nThe Book of Mormon\u2019s unholy trio of anti-Christs\u2014Sherem, Nehor, and Korihor\u2014provide a classic study of active rebellion against God. The overarching thesis of Nehor and Korihor was that there is no sin; therefore, there is no need for repentance, and there is no Savior. \u201cEvery man prosper[s] according to his genius, and \u2026 every man conquer[s] according to his strength; and whatsoever a man [does is] no crime.\u201d The anti-Christ rejects religious authority, characterizing ordinances and covenants as performances \u201claid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority.\u201d\n\nA latter-day example of willful rebellion with a happier ending is the story of William&nbsp;W. Phelps. Phelps joined the Church in 1831 and was appointed Church printer. He edited several early Church publications, wrote numerous hymns, and served as a scribe to Joseph Smith. Unfortunately, he turned against the Church and the Prophet, even to the point of giving false testimony against Joseph Smith in a Missouri court, which contributed to the Prophet\u2019s imprisonment there.\nLater, Phelps wrote to Joseph asking for forgiveness. \u201cI know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to be saved if my friends will help me.\u201d\nIn his reply the Prophet stated: \u201cIt is true that we have suffered much in consequence of your behavior. \u2026 However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Heavenly Father has been done, and we are yet alive. \u2026 Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, for friends at first are friends again at last.\u201d\nWith sincere repentance, William Phelps buried his \u201cweapons of rebellion\u201d and was received once more in full fellowship, never again to fall away.\nPerhaps the more insidious form of rebellion against God, however, is the passive version\u2014ignoring His will in our lives. Many who would never consider active rebellion may still oppose the will and word of God by pursuing their own path without regard to divine direction. I am reminded of the song made famous years ago by singer Frank Sinatra with the climactic line \u201cI did it my way.\u201d Certainly in life there is plenty of room for personal preference and individual choice, but when it comes to matters of salvation and eternal life, our theme song ought to be \u201cI did it God\u2019s way,\u201d because truly there is no other way.\nTake, for instance, the Savior\u2019s example regarding baptism. He submitted to baptism as a demonstration of loyalty to the Father and as an example to us:\n\u201cHe showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?\u201d\nThere is no \u201cmy way\u201d if we are to follow Christ\u2019s example. Trying to find a different course to heaven is like the futility of working on the Tower of Babel rather than looking to Christ and His salvation.\nThe swords and other weapons that the Lamanite converts buried were weapons of rebellion because of how they had used them. Those same kinds of weapons in the hands of their sons, being used in defense of family and freedom, were not weapons of rebellion against God at all. The same was true of such weapons in the hands of the Nephites: \u201cThey were not fighting for monarchy nor power but \u2026 were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.\u201d\nIn this same way, there are things in our lives that may be neutral or even inherently good but that used in the wrong way become \u201cweapons of rebellion.\u201d Our speech, for example, can edify or demean. As James said:\n\u201cBut the tongue [it seems] can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.\n\u201cTherewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.\n\u201cOut of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.\u201d\nThere is much in public and personal discourse today that is malicious and mean-spirited. There is much conversation that is vulgar and profane, even among youth. This sort of speech is a \u201cweapon of rebellion\u201d against God, \u201cfull of deadly poison.\u201d\nConsider another example of something that is essentially good but that could be turned against divine directives\u2014a person\u2019s career. One can find real satisfaction in a profession, vocation, or service, and all of us are benefited by what devoted and talented people in many fields of endeavor have accomplished and created.\nStill, it is possible that devotion to career can become the paramount focus of one\u2019s life. Then all else becomes secondary, including any claim the Savior may make on one\u2019s time and talent. For men, and for women as well, forgoing legitimate opportunities for marriage, failing to cleave to and lift one\u2019s spouse, failing to nurture one\u2019s children, or even intentionally avoiding the blessing and responsibility of child-rearing solely for the sake of career advancement can convert laudable achievement into a form of rebellion.\nAnother example concerns our physical being. Paul reminds us that we are to glorify God in both body and spirit and that this body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, \u201cwhich ye have of God, and ye are not your own.\u201d Thus, we have a legitimate interest in spending time caring for our bodies as best we can. Few of us will reach the peak of performance we have seen recently in the achievements of Olympic and Paralympic athletes, and some of us are experiencing the effects of age, or what President M.&nbsp;Russell Ballard called \u201cthe rivets coming loose.\u201d\nNevertheless, I believe it pleases our Creator when we do our best to care for His wonderful gift of a physical body. It would be a mark of rebellion to deface or defile one\u2019s body, or abuse it, or fail to do what one can to pursue a healthy lifestyle. At the same time, vanity and becoming consumed with one\u2019s physique, appearance, or dress can be a form of rebellion at the other extreme, leading one to worship God\u2019s gift instead of God.\nIn the end, burying our weapons of rebellion against God simply means yielding to the enticing of the Holy Spirit, putting off the natural man, and becoming \u201ca saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord.\u201d It means putting the first commandment first in our lives. It means letting God prevail. If our love of God and our determination to serve Him with all our might, mind, and strength become the touchstone by which we judge all things and make all our decisions, we will have buried our weapons of rebellion. By the grace of Christ, God will forgive our sins and rebellions of the past and will take away the stain of those sins and rebellions from our hearts. In time, He will even take away any desire for evil, as He did with those Lamanite converts of the past. Thereafter, we too \u201cnever [will] fall away.\u201d\nBurying our weapons of rebellion leads to a unique joy. With all who have ever become converted to the Lord, we are \u201cbrought to sing [the song of] redeeming love.\u201d Our Heavenly Father and His Son, our Redeemer, have confirmed Their unending commitment to our ultimate happiness through the most profound love and sacrifice. We experience Their love daily. Surely we can reciprocate with our own love and loyalty. May we bury\u2014very, very deep\u2014any element of rebellion against God in our lives and replace it with a willing heart and a willing mind. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

We can\u2019t be salt on our own; if we are to be salt of the earth, we must be bonded to the Lord, and that is what I see as I mingle with members of the Church around the world\u2014I see faithful members of the Church bonded to the Lord, committed in their efforts to serve others and be the salt of the earth.\nYour unwavering dedication is a shining example. Your service is appreciated and cherished.\nOur youth have shown remarkable courage and devotion. They have enthusiastically embraced the work of family history, and their frequent visits to the house of the Lord are a testament to their dedication. Their willingness to devote time and energy to serve missions across the globe reflects a deep and abiding faith. They are not merely participating but leading the way in becoming disciples bonded to Jesus Christ. Their service radiates light and hope, touching countless lives. To you, the youth of the Church, we express our heartfelt thanks for your inspiring service. You are not just the Church\u2019s future but its present. And you are indeed the salt of the earth!\nI love the Lord Jesus Christ and feel blessed by the opportunity to serve alongside you in the Lord\u2019s Church. Our unity and strength, grounded in our shared faith, reassure us that we are never alone in this journey. Together, we can continue to build the kingdom of God, rooted in service, love, and unwavering faith.\nWhen Jesus Christ taught by the Sea of Galilee, He often used everyday elements familiar to His audience to convey profound spiritual truths. One such element was salt. Jesus declared, \u201c[You] are the salt of the earth,\u201d a statement rich in meaning and significance, especially for the people of His time, who understood the multifaceted value of salt.\nThe ancient craft of salt harvesting in the Algarve, the southern region of my home country of Portugal, dates back thousands of years to the era of the Roman Empire. Remarkably, the methods used by the salt workers, known as *marnotos*, have changed little since then. These dedicated artisans employ traditional techniques, performing their work entirely by hand, maintaining a legacy that has endured through the centuries.\nThis ancient method harvests what is called \u201cflower of salt.\u201d To fully appreciate the intricate process of harvesting the flower of salt, it is essential to understand the environment in which it is produced. The Algarve\u2019s coastal salt marshes provide the ideal conditions for salt production. Seawater is channeled into shallow ponds, known as salt pans, where it is left to evaporate under the intense sun. As the water evaporates, the flower of salt forms delicate crystals on the surface of the salt pans. These crystals are incredibly pure and have a unique, crisp texture. The *marnotos* carefully skim the crystals from the water\u2019s surface using specialized tools, a process that requires great skill and precision. In Portugal, this fine-quality salt is referred to as \u201csalt cream\u201d because it can be gently skimmed away like cream rising to the top of milk. This delicate salt is cherished for its purity and exceptional flavor, making it a prized ingredient in culinary arts.\nJust like the *marnotos* put forth great effort to ensure they harvest the highest quality of salt, so should we, as the Lord\u2019s covenant people, always do our very best so that our love and example are, as much as possible, a pure reflection of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\nIn the ancient world, salt was more than just a seasoning\u2014it was a vital preservative and a symbol of purity and covenant. People knew that salt was essential for preserving food and enhancing flavor. They also understood the grave implications of salt losing its saltiness, or savor, by becoming contaminated or diluted.\nLike salt can lose its essence, we can also lose our spiritual vitality if our faith in Jesus Christ becomes casual. We may look the same on the outside, but without a strong inner faith, we lose our ability to make a difference in the world and bring out the best in those around us.\nSo how can we channel our energy and efforts to make a difference and be the change the world needs today? How can we preserve discipleship and continue to be a positive influence?\nThe words of our dear prophet still echo in my mind: \u201cGod wants us to work together and help each other. That is why He sends us to earth in families and organizes us into wards and stakes. That is why He asks us to serve and minister to each other. That is why He asks us to live *in* the world but not be *of* the world.\u201d\nWhen our lives are filled with purpose and service, we avoid spiritual apathy; on the other hand, when our lives are deprived of divine purpose, meaningful service to others, and sacred opportunities for pondering and reflection, we gradually become suffocated by our own activity and self-interest, risking losing our savor. The antidote to this is to continue to be involved in service\u2014being anxiously engaged in good works and the betterment of ourselves and the society we live in.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, what a blessing we all have today to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ and have the opportunity to serve in His Church. Our circumstances may vary, but we all can make a difference.\nRemember the *marnotos*, the salt workers; they use simple tools to harvest the best crystals, the best salt! We too can do simple things that, with consistent efforts in small and meaningful acts, can deepen our discipleship and commitment to Jesus Christ. Here are four simple yet profound ways we can strive to be the salt of the earth:\n\n\nKeeping the house of the Lord at the center of our devotion. Now that temples are closer than ever before, prioritizing regular worship in the house of the Lord will help us focus on what matters most and keep our lives centered in Christ. In the temple, we find the heart of our faith in Jesus Christ and the soul of our devotion to Him.\n\n\nBeing deliberate in our efforts to strengthen others by living the gospel together. We can strengthen our families through consistent and intentional efforts to bring gospel principles into our lives and to our homes.\n\n\nBeing willing to accept a calling and serving in the Church. Service in our local congregations allows us to support one another and grow together. While serving is not always convenient, it is always rewarding.\n\n\nAnd finally, using digital communication tools with purpose. Today, digital communication tools allow us to connect as never before. Like most of you, I use these tools to connect with brothers and sisters in the Church and with my family and friends. As I connect with them, I feel closer to them; we can minister to each other in times of need when we cannot be physically present. These tools are undoubtedly a blessing, yet these very same tools can drag us away from the depth of meaningful interactions and eventually cause us to be pulled into habits that waste our time in less purposeful activities. Striving to be the salt of the earth includes so much more than an endless scrolling of reels on a six-inch (15&nbsp;cm) screen.\n\n\nAs we keep the house of the Lord central in our lives, intentionally strengthen others by living the gospel, accept callings to serve, and use digital tools with purpose, we can preserve our spiritual vitality. Just as salt in its purest form has the power to enhance and preserve, so too does our faith in Jesus Christ when it is nourished and protected by our dedication to Christlike service and love.\nAs we remain bonded to the Lord, our lives will naturally reflect His light, and we will become the salt of the earth. In this effort, we not only enrich our lives but also strengthen our families and our communities. May we strive to maintain this bond with the Lord, never lose our savor, and be the small, little crystal of salt that the Lord wants us to be. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "When I was a child, as a family we went on vacation to a beach on the coast of my native country, Chile. I was excited to spend some days enjoying the summer with my family. I was also thrilled because I thought I could finally join in and do what my two older brothers usually did for fun on the water.\nOne day my brothers went to play where the waves were breaking, and I felt big and mature enough to follow them. As I moved toward that area, I realized the waves were larger than they appeared from the shore. Suddenly, a wave rapidly approached me, taking me by surprise. I felt like the power of nature had taken over me, and I was dragged into the depths of the sea. I couldn\u2019t see or feel any reference point as I was tossed around. Just as I thought my adventure on the earth might be coming to an end, I felt a hand pulling me toward the surface. Finally, I could see the sun and catch my breath.\nMy brother Claudio had seen my attempts to act as a grown-up and had come to my rescue. I was not far from the shore. Even though the water was shallow, I was disoriented and had not realized I could have helped myself. Claudio told me that I needed to be careful and, if I wanted, he could teach me. Despite the gallons of water I had swallowed, my pride and desire to be a big boy were stronger, and I said, \u201cSure.\u201d\nClaudio told me I needed to attack the waves. I told myself I would surely lose that battle against what seemed like a huge wall of water.\nAs a new big wave approached, Claudio quickly said, \u201cLook at me; this is how you do it.\u201d Claudio ran toward the incoming wave and dove into it before it broke. I was so impressed with his dive that I lost sight of the next incoming wave. So again I was sent to the depths of the sea and tossed by the forces of nature. A few seconds later, a hand grasped mine, and I was again pulled toward the surface and air. The flame of my pride was extinguishing.\nThis time my brother invited me to dive with him. As per his invitation, I followed him, and we dove together. I felt as if I was conquering the most complicated challenge. Certainly, it was not very easy, but I did it, thanks to the help and example shown by my brother. His hand rescued me twice; his example showed me how to deal with my challenge and be victorious that day.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has invited us to think celestial, and I want to follow his advice and apply it to my summer story.\n\n\nThe Savior\u2019s Power over the Adversary\n\nIf we think celestial, we will understand that in our lives we will face challenges that seem greater than our capacity to overcome them. During our mortal time, we are subject to the attacks of the adversary. Like the waves that had power over me that summer day, we can feel powerless and want to give in to a stronger fate. Those \u201cmalicious waves\u201d could jostle us from side to side. But do not forget who has power over those waves and, in fact, over all things. That is our Savior, Jesus Christ. He has the power to help us out of every miserable condition or adverse situation. Regardless of whether we feel close to Him, He still can reach us where we are as we are.\nAs we reach out to Him in faith, He will always be there, and in His time, He will be ready and willing to grasp our hands and pull us up to a safe place.\n\n\n\nThe Savior and His Ministering Example\n\nIf we think celestial, we will recognize Jesus Christ as a flawless example of ministry. There is a pattern for us in the scriptures when He or His disciples reach out to someone in need of help, rescue, or a blessing as they reach out with their hands. As in my story, I knew my brother was there, but being there for me was not enough. Claudio knew I was in trouble, and he went to help lift me from the water.\nOccasionally, we think that we only need to be there for someone in need, and many times there is more we can do. Having an eternal perspective can help us receive revelation to offer timely assistance to others in need. We can rely on the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Ghost to discern what kind of help is needed, whether it is temporal support like emotional comfort, food, or aid with daily tasks, or spiritual guidance to help others in their journey to prepare, make, and honor sacred covenants.\n\n\n\nThe Savior Is Ready to Rescue Us\n\nWhen Peter, the senior Apostle, \u201cwalked on the water, to go to Jesus, \u2026 he was afraid; and beginning to sink\u201d; then \u201che cried, saying, Lord, save me.\u201d Jesus knew the faith Peter had exercised to come unto Him on the water. He was also aware of Peter\u2019s fear. According to the account, Jesus \u201cimmediately \u2026 stretched forth his hand, and caught him,\u201d saying the following words: \u201cO thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\u201d His words were not to scold Peter but to remind him that He, the Messiah, was with him and the disciples.\nIf we think celestial, we will receive the confirmation in our hearts that Jesus Christ is indeed our Rescuer, our Advocate with the Father, and our Redeemer. As we exercise faith in Him, He will save us from our fallen state, beyond our challenges, infirmities, and needs in this temporal life, and give us the greatest of all gifts, which is eternal life.\n\n\n\nThe Savior Does Not Give Up on Us\n\nMy brother did not give up on me that day but persisted so I could learn how to do it for myself. He persisted, even if that required rescuing me *twice*. He persisted, even if I could not get it at first. He persisted so I could overcome that challenge and succeed. If we think celestial, we will realize that our Savior will be there as many times as necessary to provide help if we want to learn, change, overcome, cope, or succeed in whatever will bring true and everlasting happiness to our lives.\n\n\n\nThe Savior\u2019s Hands\n\nThe scriptures immortalize the symbol and significance of the Savior\u2019s hands. In His atoning sacrifice, His hands were pierced by nails to affix Him to the cross. After His Resurrection, He appeared to His disciples in a perfect body, but the prints in His hands remain as a reminder of His infinite sacrifice. His hand will always be there for us, even if we cannot see it or feel it at first, because He was chosen by our Heavenly Father to be our Savior, the Redeemer of all humankind.\n\n\n\nWithin Our Grasp, by Jay Bryant Ward\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hand of God, by Yongsung Kim\n\n\nIf I think celestial, I know that we are not left alone in this life. While we must face challenges and trials, our Heavenly Father knows our capabilities and knows we can bear or overcome our difficulties. We must do our part and turn to Him in faith. His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is our rescuer and will always be there. In His name, the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

That was a truly wonderful day in my life and in my eternal journey, and I\u2019m profoundly grateful for the friends who prepared the way and brought me to the waters of that new birth.\nWhether your baptism was yesterday or years ago, whether you meet in a large multiward Church building or under a thatched canopy, whether you receive the sacrament in remembrance of the Saviour in Thai or Swahili, I would like to say to you, welcome to the church of joy! Welcome to the church of joy!\n\n\nThe Church of Joy\n\nBecause of the loving plan of our Heavenly Father for each of His children, and because of the redeeming life and mission of our Saviour, Jesus Christ, we can\u2014and should\u2014be the most joyful people on earth! Even as the storms of life in an often-troubled world pound upon us, we can cultivate a growing and abiding sense of joy and inner peace because of our hope in Christ and our understanding of our own place in the beautiful plan of happiness.\nThe Lord\u2019s senior Apostle, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, has spoken of the joy that comes from a life centered on Jesus Christ in nearly every address he has given since becoming the President of the Church. He summed it up so concisely: \u201cJoy comes from and because of Him. \u2026 For Latter-day Saints, Jesus Christ is joy!\u201d\nWe are members of the Church of Jesus Christ. We are members of the church of joy! And nowhere should our joy as a people be more apparent than when we gather together each Sabbath in our sacrament meetings to worship the source of all joy! Here we assemble with our ward and branch families to celebrate the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper, our deliverance from sin and death, and the Saviour\u2019s powerful grace! Here we come to experience the joy, refuge, forgiveness, thanksgiving, and belonging found through Jesus Christ!\nIs this spirit of collective rejoicing in Christ what you find? Is this what you bring? Maybe you think this doesn\u2019t have much to do with you, or perhaps you are simply used to how things have always been done. But we can all contribute, no matter our age or our calling, to making our sacrament meetings the joy-filled, Christ-focused, welcoming hour they can be, alive with a spirit of joyful reverence.\n\n\n\nJoyful Reverence\n\n*Joyful* reverence? \u201cIs that a thing?\u201d you may ask. Well, yes, it is! We deeply love, honour, and respect our God, and our reverence flows from a soul that rejoices in Christ\u2019s abundant love, mercy, and salvation! This joyful reverence to the Lord should characterise our sacred sacrament meetings.\nHowever, for many, reverence only means this: folding our arms tightly around our chests, bowing our heads, closing our eyes, and holding still\u2014indefinitely! This might be a helpful way to teach energetic young children, but as we grow and learn, let us see that reverence is so much more than this. Is that how we would be if the Saviour were with us? No, for \u201cin [His] presence is fulness of joy\u201d!\nWell, for many of us this transformation in sacrament services will take practice.\n\n\n\nAttending versus Worshipping\n\nWe do not gather on the Sabbath simply to attend sacrament meeting and check it off the list. We come together to worship. There is a significant difference between the two. To *attend* means to be present at. But to *worship* is to intentionally praise and adore our God in a way that transforms us!\n\n\n\nOn the Stand and in the Congregation\n\nIf we are gathering in remembrance of the Saviour and the redemption He has made possible, our faces should reflect our joy and gratitude! Elder F.&nbsp;Enzio Busche once told the story of when he was a branch president and a young boy in the congregation looked at him on the stand and asked loudly, \u201cWhat is the man with that mean face doing up there?\u201d Those who sit on the stand\u2014speakers, leaders, choirs\u2014and those who gather in the congregation communicate to each other this \u201cwelcome to the church of joy\u201d through the expressions they wear on their faces!\n\n\n\nHymn Singing\n\nAs we sing, are we joining together to praise our God and King no matter the quality of our voices, or are we just mumbling or not singing at all? Scripture records that \u201cthe song of the righteous is a prayer unto [God]\u201d in which His soul delights. So let\u2019s sing! And praise Him!\n\n\n\nTalks and Testimonies\n\nWe center our talks and testimonies on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and the fruits of humbly living Their gospel, fruits that are \u201csweet above all that is sweet.\u201d Then we truly \u201cfeast \u2026 even until [we] are filled, that [we] hunger not, neither \u2026 thirst,\u201d and our burdens become lighter through the joy of the Son.\n\n\n\nThe Sacrament\n\nThe glorious focal point of our services is the blessing and receiving of the sacrament itself, the bread and the water representing the atoning gift of our Lord and the whole purpose of our gathering. This is \u201ca sacred time of spiritual renewal\u201d when we witness anew that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and make again the covenant to always remember the Saviour and keep His commandments.\nIn some seasons of life, we may approach the sacrament with heavy hearts and overwhelming loads. At other times, we come free and unburdened from cares and troubles. As we listen intently to the blessing of the bread and water and partake of those sacred tokens, we may feel to reflect on the sacrifice of the Saviour, His agonies in Gethsemane, His anguish on the cross, and the sorrows and pains He endured on our behalf. That will be what relieves our souls as we connect our suffering to His. At other times, we will feel to wonder with grateful awe at the \u201cexquisite and sweet\u201d joy of what Jesus\u2019s magnificent gift has made possible in our lives and in our eternities! We will rejoice for what is yet to come\u2014our cherished reunion with our beloved Father and risen Saviour.\nWe may have been conditioned to suppose that the purpose of the sacrament is to sit in the pew thinking only about all the ways we messed up during the week before. But let\u2019s turn that practice on its head. In the stillness, we can ponder the many ways we have seen the Lord relentlessly pursue us with His wonderful love that week! We can reflect on what it means to \u201cdiscover the *joy* of daily repentance.\u201d We can give thanks for the times the Saviour entered into our struggles and our triumphs and the occasions when we felt His grace, forgiveness, and power giving us strength to overcome our hardships and bear our burdens with patience and even good cheer.\nYes, we ponder the sufferings and injustices inflicted upon our Redeemer for our sin, and that does cause sober reflection. But we sometimes get stuck there\u2014in the garden, at the cross, inside the tomb. We fail to move upward to the joy of the tomb bursting open, the defeat of death, and Christ\u2019s victory over all that might prevent us from gaining peace and returning to our heavenly home. Whether we shed tears of sorrow or tears of gratitude during the sacrament, let it be in awesome wonder at the good news of the Father\u2019s gift of His Son!\n\n\n\nParents with Children Who Are Young or Have Special Needs\n\nNow, for parents of children who are young or have special needs, there is often no such thing as a time of stillness and quiet reflection during the sacrament. But in small moments throughout the week, you can teach by example the love, gratitude, and joy you feel for and from the Saviour as you constantly care for His little lambs. No effort in this pursuit is wasted. God is so aware of you.\n\n\n\nFamily, Ward, and Branch Councils\n\nLikewise at home, we can begin to enhance our hopes and expectations for our time at church. In family councils, we can discuss how each individual can contribute in meaningful ways to welcoming all to the church of joy! We can plan and expect to have a joyful experience at church.\nWard and branch councils can envision and create a culture of joyful reverence for our sacrament hour, identifying practical steps and visual cues to help.\n\n\n\nJoy\n\nJoy looks different for different people. For some, it may be exuberant greetings at the door. For others, it might be quietly helping people feel comfortable by smiling and sitting next to them with a kind and open heart. For those who feel left out or on the margins, the warmth of this welcome will be crucial. Ultimately, we can ask ourselves how the Saviour would want our sacrament hour to be. How would He want each one of His children to be welcomed, cared for, nourished, and loved? How would He want us to feel when we come to be renewed through remembering and worshipping Him?\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAt the start of my journey of faith, joy in Jesus Christ was my first great discovery, and it changed my world. If you have yet to discover this joy, embark on its quest. This is an invitation to receive the Saviour\u2019s gift of peace, light, and joy\u2014to revel in it, to wonder at it, and to rejoice in it every Sabbath.\nAmmon in the Book of Mormon expresses the feelings of my heart when he says:\n\u201cNow have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were [a people] that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.\n\u201cNow if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, \u2026 my joy, and my great thanksgiving.\u201d\nWelcome to the church of joy! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "In a world filled with contention and division, where civil discourse has been replaced with judgment and scorn, and friendships are defined by -isms and -ites, I have come to know that there is a clear, simple, and divine example we can look to for unity, love, and belonging. That example is Jesus Christ. I testify that He is the great unifier.\n\n\nWe Are His Friends\n\nIn December of 1832, as \u201cappearances of troubles among the nations\u201d were becoming \u201cmore visible\u201d than at any time since the organization of the Church, Latter-day Saint leaders in Kirtland, Ohio, gathered for a conference. They prayed \u201cseparately and vocally to the Lord to reveal his will unto [them].\u201d In acknowledgement of the prayers of these faithful members during times of intense trouble, the Lord comforted them, addressing the Saints three times with two powerful words: \u201cmy friends.\u201d\nJesus Christ has long called His faithful followers His friends. Fourteen times in the Doctrine and Covenants, the Savior uses the term *friend* to define a sacred and cherished relationship. I am not talking about the word *friend* as the world defines it\u2014subject to social media followers or \u201clikes.\u201d It cannot be captured in a hashtag or a number on Instagram or X.\nAdmittedly, as a teenager, I remember dreaded conversations when I heard those painful words \u201cHey, can we just be friends?\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s just stay in the friend zone.\u201d Nowhere in holy writ do we hear Him say, \u201cYe are just my friends.\u201d Rather, He taught that \u201cgreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u201d And \u201cye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye are my friends.\u201d\nThe sentiment is clear: the Savior numbers each of us and watches over us. This watchcare is not trivial or insignificant. Rather, it is exalting, elevating, and eternal. I see the Savior\u2019s declaration \u201cye are my friends\u201d as a clarion call to build higher and holier relationships among all of God\u2019s children \u201cthat we may be one.\u201d We do this as we come together seeking both opportunities to unite and a sense of belonging for all.\n\n\n\nWe Are One in Him\n\nThe Savior beautifully demonstrated this in His call to \u201ccome, follow me.\u201d He drew upon the gifts and individual attributes of a diverse group of followers to call His Apostles. He called fishermen, zealots, brothers known for their thunderous personalities, and even a tax collector. Their belief in the Savior and desire to draw unto Him united them. They looked to Him, saw God through Him, and \u201cstraightway left their nets, and followed Him.\u201d\nI too have seen how building higher and holier relationships brings us together as one. My wife, Jennifer, and I were blessed to raise our five children in New York City. There in that busy metropolis, we formed precious and sacred relationships with neighbors, school friends, business associates, faith leaders, and fellow Saints.\nIn May of 2020, just as the world was grappling with the spread of a global pandemic, members of the New York City Commission of Religious Leaders met virtually in an abruptly called meeting. There was no agenda. No special guests. Just a request to come together and discuss the challenges we were all facing as faith leaders. The Centers for Disease Control had just reported that our city was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This meant no more gathering. No more coming together.\nFor these religious leaders, removing the personal ministry, the congregational gathering, and the weekly worship was a devastating blow. Our small group\u2014which included a cardinal, reverend, rabbi, imam, pastor, monsignor, and an elder\u2014listened to, consoled, and supported one another. Instead of focusing on our differences, we saw what we had in common. We spoke of possibilities and then probabilities. We rallied and responded to questions about faith and the future. And then we prayed. Oh, how we prayed.\nIn a richly diverse city filled with complexity and colliding cultures, we saw our differences dissipate as we came together as friends with one voice, one purpose, and one prayer.\nNo longer were we looking across the table at each other but heavenward with each other. We left each subsequent meeting more united and ready to pick up our \u201cshovels\u201d and go to work. The collaboration that resulted and the service rendered to thousands of New Yorkers taught me that in a world calling for division, distance, and disengagement, there is always much more that unites us than divides us. The Savior pled, \u201cBe one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, we must stop looking for reasons to divide and instead seek opportunities to \u201cbe one.\u201d He has blessed us with unique gifts and attributes that invite learning from one another and personal growth. I often told my university students that if I do what you do and you do what I do, we don\u2019t need each other. But because you don\u2019t do what I do and I don\u2019t do what you do, we do need each other. And that need brings us together. To divide and conquer is the adversary\u2019s plan to destroy friendships, families, and faith. It is the Savior who unites.\n\n\n\nWe Belong to Him\n\nOne of the promised blessings of \u201cbecoming one\u201d is a powerful sense of belonging. Elder Quentin&nbsp;L. Cook taught that \u201cthe essence of truly belonging is to be one with Christ.\u201d\nOn a recent visit with my family to the West African country of Ghana, I was enamored with a local custom. Upon arriving at a church or home, we were greeted with the words \u201cyou are welcome.\u201d When food was served, our host would announce, \u201cYou are invited.\u201d These simple greetings were extended with purpose and intentionality. *You are welcome. You are invited.*\nWe place similar sacred declarations on our meetinghouse doors. But the sign Visitors Welcome is not enough. Do we warmly welcome all who come through the doors? Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to just sit in the pews. We must heed the Savior\u2019s call to build higher and holier relationships with all of God\u2019s children. We must live our faith! My father often reminded me that simply sitting in a pew on Sunday doesn\u2019t make you a good Christian any more than sleeping in a garage makes you a car.\nWe must live our life so that the world does not see us but sees Him through us. This does not take place only on Sundays. It takes place at the grocery store, the gas pump, the school meeting, the neighborhood gathering\u2014all places where baptized and unbaptized members of our family work and live.\nI worship on Sunday as a reminder that we need each other and together we need Him. Our unique gifts and talents that differentiate us in a secular world unite us in a sacred space. The Savior has called upon us to help one another, lift one another, and edify each other. This is what He did when He healed the woman with an issue of blood, cleansed the leper who pled for His mercy, counseled the young prince who asked what more he could do, loved Nicodemus, who knew but faltered in his faith, and sat with the woman at the well, who did not fit the custom of the day but to whom He declared His messianic mission. This to me is church\u2014a place of gathering and recovery, repair and refocus. As President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has taught: \u201cThe gospel net is the largest net in the world. God has invited *all* to come unto Him. \u2026 There is room for everyone.\u201d\nSome may have had experiences that make you feel you do not belong. The Savior\u2019s message to you and me is the same: \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d The gospel of Jesus Christ is the perfect place for us. Coming to church offers the hope of better days, the promise that you are not alone, and a family who needs us as much as we need them. Elder D.&nbsp;Todd Christofferson affirms that \u201cbeing one with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is without doubt the ultimate in belonging.\u201d To any who have stepped away and are seeking a chance to return, I offer an eternal truth and invitation: You belong. Come back. It is time.\nIn a contentious and divided world, I testify that the Savior Jesus Christ is the great unifier. May I invite each of us to be worthy of the Savior\u2019s invitation to \u201cbe one\u201d and to boldly declare, as He did, \u201cYe are my friends.\u201d In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "When I was about five years old, I was playing football with my friends behind the church in my small village in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. I vividly remember the preacher\u2019s call to his congregation to cleanse their clothes in preparation for the Savior\u2019s arrival. Being young, I took this call literally. I ran home as fast as my little legs could carry me and begged my mother to clean my few clothes so that I could be spotless and ready for the Savior\u2019s coming the next day. Although my mother was skeptical about the Savior\u2019s imminent return, she still washed my best outfit.\nThe next morning, I put on the still slightly damp clothing and eagerly waited for the announcement of the Savior\u2019s arrival. As the day wore on and nothing happened, I decided to go to the meetinghouse. I was deeply disappointed to find that the church was empty and the Savior had not arrived. You can imagine my feelings as I slowly walked home.\nYears later, as I was receiving the missionary lessons in preparation to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I read the following: \u201cAnd no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.\u201d\nThe clarification I received at that time helped me to understand the important truth that had eluded my young mind many years prior. The preacher\u2019s message was centered on the importance of spiritual purity. He urged the congregation to seek repentance, make changes in their lives, and turn to the Savior for redemption.\nOur Heavenly Father understands our mortal journey and the inevitability of sin in our lives. I am deeply thankful that He has provided a Savior to atone for our transgressions. Through the Savior\u2019s redemptive sacrifice, each of us can repent and seek forgiveness and become clean. Repentance, a foundational principle of the gospel, is essential for our spiritual development and resilience as we navigate life\u2019s challenges.\nDuring the April 2022 general conference, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson invited every member of the Church to experience the joy of daily repentance. He said:\n\u201cPlease do not fear or delay repenting. Satan delights in your misery. Cut it short. Cast his influence out of your life! Start today to experience the joy of putting off the natural man. The Savior loves us always but *especially* when we repent.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cIf you feel you have strayed off the covenant path too far or too long and have no way to return, that simply is not true.\u201d\nIf there is something that you have not fully repented of, I encourage you to heed President Nelson\u2019s call not to procrastinate your repentance. It may require some courage to engage in this process; however, I can assure you that the joy that emanates from genuine repentance surpasses understanding. Through repentance, our burdens of guilt are lifted and replaced with a sense of peace and tranquility. As we repent earnestly, we are sanctified through the Savior\u2019s blood, increasing our sensitivity to the promptings and influence of the Holy Ghost.\nMy eternal companion was born with a hearing impairment and as a result must wear hearing aids. Dust and sweat can affect the performance of these devices, and so each morning I observe her diligently cleaning the connecting tubes before wearing the aids. This simple yet consistent routine eliminates any dirt, moisture, or condensation, thereby improving her ability to hear and communicate effectively. When she overlooks this daily ritual, her ability to hear suffers throughout the day; spoken words gradually fade and eventually become inaudible. Just as her daily hearing aid cleaning allows her to hear clearly, daily repentance allows us to discern the guidance of the Lord through the Holy Ghost.\nNear the end of the Lord\u2019s mortal ministry and before His departure to the Garden of Gethsemane, He prepared His disciples to face the upcoming trials. He assured them, saying, \u201cBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d\nOne of the Holy Ghost\u2019s essential functions is to caution, lead, and guide every individual who listens to the soft, inner voice. Just as the blocked communication tubes of a hearing aid can hinder proper functionality, our spiritual connection with our Heavenly Father can also be impaired, leading to dangerous misconceptions or a failure to heed His counsel. The advent of the internet has made information more accessible than ever before. This can lead us to turn to the world for guidance rather than to God. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught, \u201cIn coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.\u201d\nI am grateful that each of us can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost at the time of our confirmation. However, President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks warned that \u201cthe blessings available through the gift of the Holy Ghost are conditioned upon worthiness [and] \u2018the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples\u2019 [[[Helaman 4|Helaman 4:24]]].\u201d\nWhen we consciously choose to follow the guidance of prophets and apostles, our capacity to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion grows. The Holy Ghost provides clarity in decision-making, prompting thoughts and impressions that align with our Heavenly Father\u2019s will. Having the Holy Ghost as a constant companion is crucial for our spiritual growth.\nI was recently assigned to preside over a stake conference at the Salt Lake Granger West Stake in Utah. During this event, I met a stake president who has diligently developed his ability to discern the promptings of the Holy Ghost through righteous living and daily repentance. As part of our ministering efforts, we coordinated visits to three households. Upon completing our final visit, we found ourselves with approximately 30&nbsp;minutes remaining before our next engagement. As we traveled back to the stake center, President Chesnut received an impression to visit one additional family. We both agreed to follow this prompting.\nWe proceeded to visit the Jones family, where we discovered Sister Jones confined to bed due to illness. It was apparent that she needed a priesthood blessing. With her permission, we administered to her. As we prepared to depart, Sister Jones asked how we knew of her urgent need for a blessing. The truth is, *we* didn\u2019t know. However, our Heavenly Father, who was aware of her needs, *did* know and inspired President Chesnut to visit her home. When we are receptive to the guidance of the still, small voice, we are better equipped to more effectively minister to those in need.\nI testify of a kind and loving Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. I testify that the Atonement of Jesus Christ is real and that as we learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost, He will lead us to repent and use the power of the Savior\u2019s Atonement in our lives. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson is the true and living prophet of the Lord, with all priesthood keys on the earth today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

The advent of the internet has made information more accessible than ever before. This can lead us to turn to the world for guidance rather than to God. President Russell&nbsp;M.

For five hours one Saturday, these attorneys interviewed over 200 residents *one by one*, each of whom had been functionally forgotten by society.\nDuring their interviews, they discovered several crimes that had been committed against the elderly residents, such as abandonment, mistreatment, and misappropriation of funds. A key pillar of this law society is to care for the poor and in need. Just two months later, the prosecutor successfully filed charges against the responsible parties.\nTheir assistance is a perfect example of King Benjamin\u2019s teaching \u201cthat when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.\u201d\nOne resident I personally interviewed during the pro bono project was a kindhearted 93-year-old woman named L\u00facia. Grateful for our service, she jokingly exclaimed, \u201cMarry me!\u201d\nSurprised, I responded: \u201cLook over there at that beautiful young woman! She is my wife and the state prosecutor.\u201d\nShe quickly fired back: \u201cSo what? She is young, pretty, and can easily get married again. All I have is you!\u201d\nThe wonderful residents did not have *all* their problems solved that day. They undoubtedly continued to experience hardship from time to time like the Jaredites in their boats on the challenging journey to the promised land, \u201cburied in the depths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon them.\u201d\nBut that Saturday, the nursing home residents knew that regardless of their earthly anonymity, they were known personally by a loving Heavenly Father, One who responds to even the simplest of prayers.\nThe Master of masters caused \u201ca furious wind\u201d to blow the Jaredites toward promised blessings. Similarly, we can decide to serve as a humble gust of wind in the Lord\u2019s hands. Just as \u201cthe wind did never cease to blow\u201d the Jaredites toward the promised land, we can help others progress in their journey to receive God\u2019s blessings.\nSeveral years ago, when Chris, my dear wife, and I were interviewed for my calling as bishop, our stake president asked me to prayerfully consider names to recommend as counselors. After hearing the names I recommended, he said I should know a few things about one of the brethren.\nFirst, this brother could not read. Second, he didn\u2019t have a car he could use to visit members. Third, he always\u2014*always*\u2014used sunglasses at church. Despite the president\u2019s honest concerns, I felt strongly that I should still recommend him as my counselor, and the stake president supported me.\nThe Sunday my counselors and I were sustained in sacrament meeting, the surprise on the members\u2019 faces was evident. This dear brother slowly made his way up to the stand, where the overhead lights reflected brightly across his sunglasses.\nAs he sat by my side, I asked him, \u201cBrother, do you have problems with your vision?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThen why do you use sunglasses at church?\u201d I asked. \u201cMy friend, the members need to see your eyes, and you must be able to see them better too.\u201d\nIn that moment, he took off his sunglasses and never used them at church again.\nThis beloved brother served at my side until my release as bishop. Today, he continues to serve faithfully in the Church and is an example of dedication and commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ. And yet, years ago, he was an unknown sunglass-wearer sitting essentially forgotten in the pews of the chapel. I often wonder, \u201cHow many faithful brothers and sisters sit forgotten among us today?\u201d\nWhether we are well-known or forgotten, trials will inevitably come to each one of us. As we turn to the Savior, He can \u201cconsecrate [our] afflictions for [our] gain\u201d and help us respond to our trials in a way that facilitates our spiritual progression. Whether for nursing home residents, a misjudged Church member, or anyone else, we can be \u201cthe wind [that] did never cease to blow,\u201d bringing hope and guiding others to the covenant path.\nOur beloved prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, made an exciting and inspiring invitation to the youth: \u201cI reaffirm strongly that the Lord has asked *every* worthy, able young man to prepare for and serve a mission. For Latter-day Saint young men, missionary service is a priesthood responsibility. \u2026 For you young and able sisters, a mission is also a powerful, but *optional*, opportunity.\u201d\nEvery day, thousands of young men and women answer the Lord\u2019s prophetic call by serving as missionaries. You are brilliant, and as President Nelson has said, you can \u201chave more impact on the world than any previous generation!\u201d Of course, that does not mean you will be the best version of *yourselves* the moment you step foot in the missionary training center.\nInstead, you might feel like Nephi, \u201cled by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which [you] should do. Nevertheless [you] went forth.\u201d\nPerhaps you feel insecure like Jeremiah did and want to say, \u201cI cannot speak: for I am a child.\u201d\nYou might even see your personal shortcomings and want to cry out like Moses did: \u201cO my Lord, I am not eloquent \u2026&nbsp;: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\u201d\nIf any of you beloved and mighty young men and women is having a thought like this right now, remember that the Lord has answered, \u201cSay not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee.\u201d And He promises, \u201cTherefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.\u201d\nYour transformation from your natural to spiritual self will occur \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept\u201d as you earnestly strive to serve Jesus Christ in the mission field through daily repentance, faith, exact obedience, and hard work to \u201cfind constantly, teach repentance, and baptize converts.\u201d\nThough you wear a name tag, sometimes you may feel unrecognized or forgotten. However, you must know that you have a perfect Heavenly Father, who knows you personally, and a Savior, who loves you. You will have mission leaders who, despite their imperfections, will serve you as \u201cthe wind [that] did never cease to blow\u201d in guiding you along your journey of personal conversion.\nIn the \u201cland that floweth with milk and honey\u201d you will serve in on your mission, you will be spiritually reborn and become a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ as you draw near to Him. You can come to know that you are never forgotten.\nThough some may wait \u201ca long time\u201d for relief, for they \u201chave no man\u201d that can yet help, the Lord Jesus Christ has taught us that no one is ever forgotten by Him. On the contrary, He was a perfect example of seeking out the one in every moment of His mortal ministry.\nEach of us\u2014and those around us\u2014faces our own storms of opposition and waves of trials that submerge us daily. But \u201cthe wind [will not] cease to blow towards the promised land \u2026&nbsp;; and thus [we shall be] driven forth before the wind.\u201d\nEach of us can be a part of this wind\u2014the same wind that blessed the Jaredites in their journey and the same wind that, with our help, will bless the unrecognized and forgotten to reach their own promised lands.\nI testify that Jesus Christ is our Advocate with the Father. He is a living God and acts as a strong wind that will always guide us along the covenant path. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "On a certain occasion, the Savior spoke of a merchant man who was searching for \u201cgoodly pearls.\u201d During the merchant man\u2019s search, he found one \u201cof great price.\u201d However, in order to acquire the magnificent pearl, this man had to sell all his possessions, which he promptly and joyfully did.\nThrough this short and thoughtful parable, the Savior beautifully taught that the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a priceless pearl, truly the most precious treasure that should be desired over all else. The fact that the merchant instantly sold all his possessions to obtain that valuable pearl clearly indicates that we should align our mind and desires with the will of the Lord and willingly do everything we can during our mortal journey to attain the eternal blessings of God\u2019s kingdom.\nTo be worthy of this great reward, we certainly need, among other things, to give our best effort to set aside all self-centered pursuits and abandon any entanglement that holds us back from full commitment to the Lord and His higher and holier ways. The Apostle Paul refers to these sanctifying pursuits as \u201chav[ing] the mind of Christ.\u201d As exemplified by Jesus Christ, this means \u201c[doing] always those things that please [the Lord]\u201d in our lives, or as some people say nowadays, this is \u201cdoing what works for the Lord.\u201d\nIn a gospel sense, \u201c[doing] always those things that please [the Lord]\u201d relates to submitting our will to His will. The Savior thoughtfully taught the importance of this principle while instructing His disciples:\n\u201cFor I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.\n\u201cAnd this is the Father\u2019s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.\n\u201cAnd this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\u201d\nThe Savior achieved a perfect and divine level of submission to the Father by allowing His will to be swallowed up in the Father\u2019s will. He once said, \u201cAnd he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.\u201d In teaching the Prophet Joseph Smith about the anguish and agonies of the Atonement, the Savior said:\n\u201cFor behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cWhich suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit\u2014and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink\u2014\n\u201cNevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.\u201d\nDuring our sojourn in mortality, we often wrestle with what we think we know, what we think is best, and what we assume works for us, as opposed to comprehending what Heavenly Father actually knows, what is eternally best, and what absolutely works for children within His plan. This great wrestle can become very complex, especially considering the prophecies contained in the scriptures for our day: \u201cThis know also, that in the last days \u2026 men shall be lovers of their own selves, \u2026 lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.\u201d\nOne sign that indicates fulfillment of this prophecy is the current growing trend in the world, adopted by so many, of people becoming consumed with themselves and constantly proclaiming, \u201cNo matter what, I live my own truth or I do what works for me.\u201d As Paul the Apostle said, they \u201cseek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ\u2019s.\u201d This way of thinking is often justified as being \u201cauthentic\u201d by those who indulge in self-centered pursuits, focus on personal preferences, or want to justify certain types of behavior that frequently don\u2019t match God\u2019s loving plan and His will for them. If we let our heart and mind embrace this way of thinking, we can create significant stumbling blocks for ourselves in acquiring the most priceless pearl that God has lovingly prepared for His children\u2014eternal life.\nWhile it is true that each of us travels an individualized discipleship journey on the covenant path, striving to keep our hearts and minds centered on Christ Jesus, we need to be careful and constantly vigilant to not be tempted to adopt this type of worldly philosophy in our life. Elder Quentin&nbsp;L. Cook said that \u201cbeing sincerely Christlike is an even more important goal than being authentic.\u201d\nMy dear friends, when we choose to let God be the most powerful influence in our life over our self-serving pursuits, we can make progress in our discipleship and increase our capacity to unite our mind and heart with the Savior. On the other hand, when we don\u2019t allow God\u2019s way to prevail in our life, we are left to ourselves, and without the Lord\u2019s inspiring guidance, we can justify almost anything we do or don\u2019t do. We can also make excuses for ourselves by doing things our own way, saying in effect, \u201cI am just doing things my way.\u201d\nOn one occasion, while the Savior was declaring His doctrine, some people, particularly self-righteous Pharisees, rejected His message and boldly declared that they were children of Abraham, implying that their lineage would grant them special privileges in the sight of God. That mentality led them to lean unto their own understanding and to disbelieve what the Savior was teaching. The Pharisees\u2019 reaction to Jesus was clear evidence that their presumptuous attitude left no place in their hearts for the Savior\u2019s words and God\u2019s way. In response, Jesus wisely and courageously declared that if they were true covenant children of Abraham, they would do the works of Abraham, especially considering that the God of Abraham was standing before them and teaching them the truth at that very moment.\nBrothers and sisters, as you can see, acting on these mental gymnastics of \u201cwhat works for me\u201d versus doing \u201cwhat always pleases the Lord\u201d is not a new trend that is unique to our day. It is an age-old mentality that has crossed the centuries and often blinds the wise-in-their-own-eyes and confuses and exhausts many of God\u2019s children. This mentality is, in fact, an old trick of the adversary; it is a deceptive path that carefully leads God\u2019s children away from the true and faithful covenant path. While personal circumstances such as genetics, geography, and physical and mental challenges do influence our journey, in things that truly matter, there is an inner space where we are free to choose whether or not we will decide to follow the pattern the Lord has prepared for our life. Truly, \u201cHe marked the path and led the way, and ev\u2019ry point [defined].\u201d\nAs Christ\u2019s disciples, we desire to walk the path He marked for us during His mortal ministry. We not only desire to do His will and all that will please Him but also seek to emulate Him. As we strive to be true to every covenant we have entered into and live \u201cby every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,\u201d we will be protected against falling victim to the sins and errors of the world\u2014errors of philosophy and doctrine that would lead us away from those most precious pearls.\nI have been personally inspired by how such spiritual submissiveness to God has impacted the lives of faithful disciples of Christ as they chose to do those things that work for and are pleasing in the sight of the Lord. I know a young man who was unsettled about going on a mission but felt inspired to go and serve the Lord when he listened to a senior leader of the Church sharing his own personal testimony and sacred experience of serving as a missionary.\nIn his own words, this young man, now a returned missionary, said: \u201cAs I listened to the testimony of an Apostle of the Savior Jesus Christ, I was able to feel of God\u2019s love for me, and I desired to share that love with others. At that moment I knew that I should serve a mission despite my fears, doubts, and concerns. I felt totally confident in the blessings and promises of God for His children. Today, I am a new person; I have a testimony that this gospel is true and that the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored on earth.\u201d This young man chose the Lord\u2019s way and became an example of a true disciple in every aspect.\nA faithful young woman decided not to compromise her standards when she was asked to dress immodestly to fit into the business division of the fashion company where she worked. Understanding that her body is a sacred gift from our Heavenly Father and a place where the Spirit can dwell, she was moved to live by a standard higher than the world\u2019s. She not only gained the confidence of those who saw her living by the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ but also preserved her job, which for a moment was in jeopardy. Her willingness to do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, rather than what worked for the world, gave her covenant confidence amidst difficult choices.\nBrothers and sisters, we are constantly confronted by similar decisions in our daily journey. It takes a courageous and a willing heart to pause and pursue an honest and meek introspection to acknowledge the presence of weaknesses of the flesh in our life that may impede our ability to submit ourselves to God, and ultimately decide to adopt His way rather than our own. The ultimate test of our discipleship is found in our willingness to give up and lose our old self and submit our heart and our whole soul to God so that His will becomes ours.\nOne of the most glorious moments of mortality occurs when we discover the joy that comes when doing always those things that \u201cwork for and please the Lord\u201d and \u201cwhat works for us\u201d become one and the same! To decisively and unquestioningly make the Lord\u2019s will our own requires majestic and heroic discipleship! At that sublime moment, we become consecrated to the Lord, and we totally yield our wills to Him. Such spiritual submissiveness, so to speak, is beautiful, powerful, and transformational.\nI testify to you that following the Lord\u2019s will in our life will enable us to find the most precious pearl in the world\u2014the kingdom of heaven. I pray that each of us, in our time and turn, will be able to declare, with covenant confidence, to our Heavenly Father and Savior Jesus Christ that \u201cwhat works for Thee works for me.\u201d I say these things in the sacred name of the Savior Jesus Christ, amen.",

On one team was Grandpa (me) and two of the grandchildren, ages 12 and 11. On the other team was an artificial intelligence (AI) program prompted by a cousin to tell dad jokes in the style of Gerrit&nbsp;W. Gong. Grandpa Gerrit Gong versus AI Gerrit Gong.\nThe grandchildren and I went first.\nWhat do you call a dinosaur who crashes his car? Tyrannosaurus Wrecks.\nAI Gerrit Gong was instructed\u2014think like Gerrit&nbsp;W. Gong. Talk like him.\nAI Gerrit Gong\u2014\u201cHere is a dad joke as if spoken by Gerrit&nbsp;W. Gong, embracing his warm, thoughtful, and uplifting style: Why did the humble tree make people smile? Because it was rooted in love and reached out with branches of kindness. Like that tree, we too can find strength in our roots and joy in extending kindness to others.\u201d\nWell, what do you think? That\u2019s why they\u2019re called dad jokes.\nAll around us are opportunities to laugh, delight, see with grateful eyes. Ours is a gospel of joy and holiness in everyday life. Holiness sets things apart for sacred purpose. But holiness also invites us to infuse daily living with the sacred\u2014to rejoice in daily bread amidst this world\u2019s thistles and thorns. To walk with the Lord, we must become holy, for He is holy, and to help us become holy, the Lord invites us to walk with Him.\nWe each have a story. As Sister Gong and I meet you\u2014Church members and friends in many places and circumstances\u2014your stories of holiness to the Lord in everyday life inspire us. You live seven Cs: **c**ommunion with God, **c**ommunity and **c**ompassion with each other, **c**ommitment and **c**ovenant with God, family, and friends\u2014**c**entered in Jesus **C**hrist.\nGrowing evidence highlights this striking fact: religious believers are on average happier, healthier, and more fulfilled than those without spiritual commitment or connection. Happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, close social relationships, even financial and material stability\u2014on each measure, religious practitioners flourish.\nThey enjoy better physical and mental health and greater life satisfaction across all ages and demographic groups.\nWhat researchers call \u201creligious structural stability\u201d offers clarity, purpose, and inspiration amidst life\u2019s twists and turns. The household of faith and community of Saints combat isolation and the lonely crowd. Holiness to the Lord says no to the profane, no to snarky cleverness at others\u2019 expense, no to algorithms that monetize anger and polarization. Holiness to the Lord says yes to the sacred and reverent, yes to our becoming our freest, happiest, most authentic, best selves as we follow Him in faith.\nWhat does holiness to the Lord in everyday life look like?\nHoliness to the Lord in everyday life looks like two faithful young adults, married for a year, sharing with authenticity and vulnerability gospel covenants, sacrifice, and service in their unfolding lives.\nShe begins, \u201cIn high school, I was in a dark place. I felt like God wasn\u2019t there for me. One night, a text from a friend said, \u2018Hey, have you read [[Alma 36|Alma 36]] ever?\u2019\n\u201cAs I started reading,\u201d she said, \u201cI was overcome with peace and love. I felt like I was being given this big hug. When I read [[Alma 36|Alma 36:12]], I knew Heavenly Father saw me and knew exactly how I was feeling.\u201d\nShe continues, \u201cBefore we got married, I was honest with my fianc\u00e9 that I didn\u2019t have a great testimony of tithing. Why did God need us to give money when others had so much to give? My fianc\u00e9 helped explain it\u2019s not about money but following a commandment asked of us. He challenged me to start paying tithing.\n\u201cI really saw my testimony grow,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes money gets tight, but we saw so many blessings, and somehow paychecks were enough.\u201d\nAlso, \u201cin my nursing class,\u201d she said, \u201cI was the only member of the Church and the only one married. Many times I left class frustrated or crying because I felt classmates singled me out and made negative comments about my beliefs, my wearing my garments, or my being married so young.\u201d\nYet she continues, \u201cThis past semester I learned how to better voice my beliefs and be a good gospel example. My knowledge and testimony grew because I was tested in my ability to stand alone and be strong in what I believe.\u201d\nThe young husband adds, \u201cBefore my mission I had offers to play college baseball. Making the difficult decision, I put those offers aside and went to serve the Lord. I wouldn\u2019t trade those two years for anything.\n\u201cReturning home,\u201d he said, \u201cI expected a difficult transition but found myself stronger, faster, and healthier. I was throwing harder than when I left. I had more offers to play than when I left, including my dream school. And, most importantly,\u201d he said, \u201cI rely upon the Lord more than ever.\u201d\nHe concludes, \u201cAs a missionary I taught that Heavenly Father promises us power in our prayers, but sometimes I forget that for myself.\u201d\nOur treasury of missionary holiness-to-the-Lord blessings is rich and full. Finances, timing, and other circumstances are often not easy. But when missionaries of all ages and backgrounds consecrate holiness to the Lord, things can work out in the Lord\u2019s time and way.\nNow with a 48-year perspective, a senior missionary shares, \u201cMy dad wanted me to get a college education, not go on a mission. Shortly after that, he had a heart attack and died at age 47. I felt guilty. How could I make things right with my father?\n\u201cLater,\u201d he continues, \u201cafter I decided to serve a mission, I saw my father in a dream. Peaceful and contented, he was happy I would serve.\u201d\nThis senior missionary continues, \u201cAs [[D&C 138|Doctrine and Covenants section 138]] teaches, I believe my father could serve as a missionary in the spirit world. I picture my father helping our great-grandfather, who left Germany at age 17 and was lost to the family, be found again.\u201d\nHis wife adds, \u201cAmong the five brothers in my husband\u2019s family, the four who served missions are the ones with college degrees.\u201d\nHoliness to the Lord in everyday life looks like a young returning missionary who learned to let God prevail in his life. Earlier, when asked to bless someone who was very sick, this missionary said, \u201cI have faith; I will bless him to recover. Yet,\u201d the returning missionary says, \u201cI learned in that moment to pray not for what I wanted but for what the Lord knew the person needed. I blessed the brother with peace and comfort. He later passed away peacefully.\u201d\nHoliness to the Lord in everyday life feels like a spark arcing across the veil to connect, comfort, and strengthen. An administrator at a major university says he feels individuals he knows only by reputation praying for him. Those individuals devoted their lives to the university and continue to care about its mission and students.\nA sister does her best each day, after her husband was unfaithful to her and the children. I deeply admire her and others like her. One day while folding laundry, her hand on a stack of garments, she sighed to herself, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d She felt a tender voice assure her, \u201cYour covenants are with me.\u201d\nFor 50 years, another sister yearned for a relationship with her father. \u201cGrowing up,\u201d she says, \u201cthere were my brothers and my dad, and then there was me\u2014the only daughter. All I ever wanted was to be \u2018good enough\u2019 for my dad.\n\u201cThen my mom passed away! She was my only liaison between my dad and me.\n\u201cOne day,\u201d the sister said, \u201cI heard a voice say, \u2018Invite your dad and take him to the temple with you.\u2019 That was the beginning of a twice-a-month date with my daddy to the house of the Lord. I told my dad I loved him. He told me he loved me too.\n\u201cSpending time in the house of the Lord has healed us. My mom could not help us on earth. It took her being on the other side of the veil to help mend what was broken. The temple completed our journey to wholeness as an eternal family.\u201d\nThe father says, \u201cThe temple dedication was a great spiritual experience for me and my only daughter. Now we attend together and feel our love strengthen.\u201d\nHoliness to the Lord in everyday life includes tender moments when loved ones pass. Earlier this year, my dear mother, Jean Gong, slipped into the next life days before her 98th birthday.\nIf you asked my mother, \u201cWould you like rocky road, white chocolate ginger, or strawberry ice cream?\u201d Mom would say, \u201cYes, please, may I taste each one?\u201d Who could say no to your mother, especially when she loved all of life\u2019s flavors?\nI once asked Mom which decisions had most shaped her life.\nShe said, \u201cBeing baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and moving from Hawaii to the mainland, where I met your father.\u201d\nBaptized as a 15-year-old, the only member of her large family to join our Church, my mother had covenant faith and trust in the Lord that blessed her life and all our family generations. I miss my mother, as you miss members in your family. But I know my mother is not gone. She is just not here now. I honor her and all who pass as valiant examples of everyday holiness to the Lord.\nOf course, holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes coming more often to the Lord in His holy house. This is true whether we are Church members or friends.\nThree friends came to the Bangkok Thailand Temple open house.\n\u201cThis is a place of super healing,\u201d said one.\nIn the baptistry, another said, \u201cWhen I am here, I want to be washed clean and never sin again.\u201d\nThe third said, \u201cCan you feel the spiritual power?\u201d\nWith nine sacred words, our temples invite and proclaim:\n\u201cHoliness to the Lord.\n\u201cThe House of the Lord.\u201d\nHoliness to the Lord makes daily living sacred. It draws us closer and happier to the Lord and each other and prepares us to live with God our Father, Jesus Christ, and our loved ones.\nAs did my friend, you may wonder if your Heavenly Father loves you. The answer is a resounding, absolute yes! We can feel His love as we make holiness to the Lord ours each day, happy and forever. May we do so, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "About 10&nbsp;years ago I felt impressed to paint a portrait of the Savior. Though I am an artist, this felt a bit overwhelming. How was *I* to paint a portrait of Jesus Christ that captured His Spirit? Where was I to begin? And where would I find the time?\nEven with my questions, I decided to move forward and trust that the Lord would help me. But I had to keep moving and leave the *possibilities* to Him. I prayed, pondered, researched, and sketched and was blessed to find help and resources. And what was a white canvas started to become something more.\n\nThe process wasn\u2019t easy. Sometimes it didn\u2019t look as I had hoped. Sometimes there were moments of inspired strokes and ideas. And many times, I just had to try again and again and again.\nWhen I thought the oil painting was finally complete and dry, I began to apply a transparent varnish to protect it from dirt and dust. As I did, I noticed the hair in the painting start to change, smear, and dissolve. I quickly realized that I had applied the varnish too soon, that part of the painting was still wet!\nI had literally wiped away a portion of my painting with the varnish. Oh, how my heart sank. I felt as though I had just destroyed what God had helped me to do. I cried and felt sick inside. In despair, I did what anyone would typically do in a situation like this: I called my mother. She wisely and calmly said, \u201cYou won\u2019t get back what you had, but do the very best you can with what you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd I Partook, by Kristin M. Yee\n\n\nSo I prayed and pled for help and painted through the night to repair things. And I remember looking at the painting in the morning\u2014it looked better than it did before. How was that possible? What I thought was a mistake without mend was an opportunity for His merciful hand to be manifest. He was not done with the painting, and He was not done with me. What joy and relief filled my heart. I praised the Lord for His mercy, for this miracle that not only saved the painting but taught me more about His love and power to save each of us from our mistakes, weaknesses, and sins and to help us become something more.\nJust as the depth of my gratitude for the Savior grew as He mercifully helped me to repair the \u201cunrepairable\u201d painting, so has my personal love and gratitude for my Savior intensified as I\u2019ve sought to work with Him on my weaknesses and to be forgiven of my mistakes. I will forever be grateful to my Savior that I can change and be cleansed. He has my heart, and I hope to do whatever He would have me do and become.\nRepenting allows us to feel God\u2019s love and to know and love Him in ways we would never otherwise know. Of the woman who anointed the Savior\u2019s feet, He said, \u201cHer sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.\u201d She loved Jesus much, for He had forgiven her much.\nThere is such relief and hope in knowing that we *can* try again\u2014that, as Elder David&nbsp;A. Bednar taught, we can receive an ongoing remission of our sins through the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost as we truly and sincerely repent.\nThe redeeming power of Jesus Christ is one of the greatest promised blessings of our covenants. Ponder this as you participate in sacred ordinances. Without it, we could not return home to the presence of our Father in Heaven and those we love.\nI know that our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is mighty to save. As the Son of God, who atoned for the sins of the world and laid down His own life and took it up again, He holds the power of redemption and resurrection. He has made possible immortality for all and eternal life for those who choose Him. I know that through His atoning sacrifice, we can repent and truly be cleansed and redeemed. It is a miracle He loves you and me in this way.\nHe has said, \u201cWill ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?\u201d He can heal the \u201cwaste places\u201d of your soul\u2014the places made dry, harsh, and desolate by sin and sorrow\u2014and \u201cmake [your] wilderness like Eden.\u201d\nJust as we cannot comprehend the agony and depth of Christ\u2019s suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross, so we \u201ccannot measure the bounds nor fathom the depths of [His] divine forgiveness,\u201d mercy, and love.\nYou may feel at times that it\u2019s not possible to be redeemed, that perhaps you are an exception to God\u2019s love and the Savior\u2019s atoning power because of what you are struggling with or because of what you\u2019ve done. But I testify that you are not beneath the Master\u2019s reach. The Savior \u201cdescended below all things\u201d and is in a divine position to lift you and claim you from the darkest abyss and bring you into \u201chis marvellous light.\u201d Through His sufferings, He has made a way for each of us to overcome our personal weaknesses and sins. \u201cHe has* all* power to save *every *man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.\u201d\nJust as it required work and pleading for heaven\u2019s help to repair the painting, it takes work, sincerity of heart, and humility to bring \u201cforth fruit meet for repentance.\u201d These fruits include exercising our faith and trust in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice, offering to God a broken heart and a contrite spirit, confessing and forsaking sin, restoring that which has been damaged to the best of our ability, and striving to live righteously.\nTo truly repent and change, we must first be \u201cconvinced of our sins.\u201d A person does not see the need to take medicine unless they understand that they are ill. There may be times we may not be willing to look inside ourselves and see that which really needs healing and repair.\nIn C.&nbsp;S. Lewis\u2019s writings, Aslan poses these words to a man who has entangled himself in his own devices: \u201cOh [humankind], how cleverly you defend yourselves [from] all that might do you good!\u201d\nWhere might you and I be defending ourselves from those things that might do us good?\nLet us not defend ourselves from the good that God desires to bless us with. From the love and mercy that He desires us to feel. From the light and knowledge He desires to bestow upon us. From the healing that He knows we so readily need. From the deeper covenant relationship He intends for all His sons and daughters.\nI pray we may lay aside any \u201cweapons of war\u201d that we\u2019ve consciously or even unconsciously taken up to defend ourselves from the blessings of God\u2019s love. Weapons of pride, selfishness, fear, hate, offense, complacency, unrighteous judgment, jealousies\u2014anything that would keep us from loving God with *all* our hearts and keeping *all* our covenants with Him.\nAs we live our covenants, the Lord can give us the help and power we need to both recognize and overcome our weaknesses, including the spiritual parasite of pride. Our prophet has said:\n\u201cRepentance is the pathway to purity, and purity brings power.\u201d\n\u201cAnd oh, how we will need His power in the days ahead.\u201d\nLike my painting, the Lord is not done with us when we make a mistake, nor does He flee when we falter. Our need for healing and help is not a burden to Him, but the very reason He came. The Savior Himself said:\n\u201cBehold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin.\u201d\n\u201cMine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.\u201d\nSo come\u2014come ye that are weary, worn, and sad; come and leave your labors and find rest in Him who loves you most. Take His yoke upon you, for He is gentle and lowly in heart.\nOur Heavenly Father and Savior see you. They know your heart. They care about what you care about, including those you love.\nThe Savior can redeem that which was lost, including broken and fractured relationships. He has made a way for all that is fallen to be redeemed\u2014to breathe life into that which feels dead and hopeless.\nIf you are struggling with a situation you think you should have overcome by now, don\u2019t give up. Be patient with yourself, keep your covenants, repent often, seek the help of your leaders if needed, and go to the house of the Lord as regularly as you can. Listen for and heed the promptings He sends you. He will not abandon His covenant relationship with you.\nThere have been difficult and complex relationships in my life that I have struggled with and sincerely sought to improve. At times I felt like I was failing more often than not. I wondered, \u201cDid I not fix things the last time? Did I not truly overcome my weakness?\u201d I\u2019ve learned over time that I am not necessarily defective; rather, there is often more to work on and more healing that is needed.\n\nElder D.&nbsp;Todd Christofferson taught: \u201cSurely the Lord smiles upon one who desires to come to judgment worthily, who resolutely labors day by day to replace weakness with strength. Real repentance, real change may require repeated attempts, but there is something refining and holy in such striving. Divine forgiveness and healing flow quite naturally to such a soul.\u201d\nEach day is a new day filled with hope and possibilities because of Jesus Christ. Each day you and I can come to know, as Mother Eve proclaimed, \u201cthe joy of our redemption,\u201d the joy of being made whole, the joy of feeling God\u2019s unfailing love for you.\nI know that our Father in Heaven and Savior love you. Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. He lives. Through His atoning sacrifice, the bands of sin and death were *forever* broken so that we might be *free* to choose healing, redemption, and eternal life with those we love. And I testify of these things in His name, Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "My purpose this day and always is to testify of Jesus Christ, that He is the Son of God, the Creator and Savior of the world, our Deliverer and Redeemer. Because \u201cthe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ,\u201d today I share with you my knowledge and testimony of the Savior as they have been strengthened and deepened by the life and teachings of one key apostle and prophet.\n\n\nThe Beginning of Wisdom\n\nOn the morning of a beautiful clear day early in the spring of 1820, 14-year-old Joseph Smith entered a grove of trees near his family\u2019s home to pray about his sins and to ask which church to join. His sincere prayer, offered with unwavering faith, received the attention of the most powerful forces in the universe, including the Father and the Son. And the devil. Each of these had an intense interest in that prayer and in that boy.\nWhat we now call the First Vision marked the beginning of the Restoration of all things in this last dispensation. But for Joseph, the experience was also personal and preparatory. All he wanted was forgiveness and direction. The Lord gave him both. The instruction to \u201cjoin none of [the churches]\u201d was directive. The words \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee\u201d were redemptive.\nFor all the beautiful truths we might learn from that First Vision, perhaps Joseph\u2019s main takeaway was simply, \u201cI had found the testimony of James to be true\u2014that a man who lacked wisdom might ask of God, and obtain.\u201d\nAs one scholar noted: \u201cThe real resonance of the First Vision today is to know that it\u2019s the nature of God to give to those who lack wisdom. \u2026 The God that reveals Himself to Joseph Smith in the sacred grove is a God who answers teenagers in times of trouble.\u201d\nJoseph\u2019s experience in the grove gave him confidence to ask for *forgiveness* and *direction* for the rest of his life. His experience has also given *me* confidence to ask for forgiveness and direction for the rest of my life.\n\n\n\nRegular Repentance\n\nOn September&nbsp;21, 1823, Joseph earnestly prayed for forgiveness, confident that because of his experience in the grove three years earlier, heaven would respond again. And it did. The Lord sent an angel, Moroni, to instruct Joseph and inform him of an ancient record he would later translate by the gift and power of God\u2014the Book of Mormon.\nAlmost 13 years after that, Joseph and Oliver Cowdery knelt in solemn, silent prayer in the newly dedicated Kirtland Temple. We do not know what they prayed for, but their prayers likely included a plea for forgiveness, for, as they arose, the Savior appeared and declared, \u201cBehold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me.\u201d\nIn the months and years after this experience, Joseph and Oliver would sin again. And again. But in that moment, *for* that moment, in response to their plea and in preparation for the glorious restoration of priesthood keys that was about to happen, Jesus made them sinless.\nJoseph\u2019s life of regular repentance gives me confidence to \u201ccome boldly unto the throne of grace, that [I] may obtain mercy.\u201d I have learned that Jesus Christ truly is \u201cof a forgiving disposition.\u201d It is neither His mission nor His nature to condemn. He came to save.\n\n\n\nInquiring of the Lord\n\nAs part of the promised \u201crestitution of all things,\u201d the Lord, through Joseph Smith, brought forth the Book of Mormon and other revelations that contain the fulness of His gospel. Vital truths were given clarity and completeness as Joseph repeatedly inquired of the Lord for direction. Consider the following:\n\n\n\nThe Father and the Son have bodies \u201cas tangible as man\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\nJesus took upon Himself not only our sins but also our sicknesses, afflictions, and infirmities.\n\n\nHis Atonement was so excruciating it caused Him to bleed from every pore.\n\n\nWe are saved by His grace \u201cafter all we can do.\u201d\n\n\nThere are conditions to Christ\u2019s mercy.\n\n\nAs we come unto Christ, He will not only forgive our sins, but He will also change our very nature so \u201cthat we have no more disposition to do evil.\u201d\n\n\nChrist always commands His people to build temples, where He manifests Himself unto them and endows them with power from on high.\n\n\nI testify that all these things are true and necessary. They represent only a fraction of the fulness that was restored by Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith in response to Joseph\u2019s recurring requests for direction.\n\n\n\nRolling on This Kingdom\n\nIn 1842, Joseph wrote of amazing things that would come to pass in this last dispensation. He declared that during our day, \u201cthe heavenly Priesthood will unite with the earthly, to bring about those great purposes; and whilst we are thus united in the one common cause, to roll forth the kingdom of God, the heavenly Priesthood are not idle spectators.\u201d\nTo his friend Benjamin Johnson, Joseph said, \u201cBenjamin, [if I die] I [would] not be far away from you, and if on the other side of the veil, I [would] still be working with you, and with a power greatly increased, to roll on this kingdom.\u201d\nOn June&nbsp;27, 1844, Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered. Joseph\u2019s body was laid to rest, but his testimony continues to reverberate around the world and in my soul:\n\u201cI had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it.\u201d\n\u201cI never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught.\u201d\n\u201cThe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.\u201d\nWhat was said of John the Baptist might also be said of Joseph Smith: \u201cThere was a man sent from God, whose name was [Joseph]. \u2026 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light,\u201d \u201cthat all men through him might believe.\u201d\nI believe. I believe and am sure that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I testify that the living God is our loving Father. I know this because the voice of the Lord has spoken it to me, and so has the voice of His servants, the apostles and prophets, including and beginning with Joseph Smith.\nI testify that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, a witness and servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was \u201cblessed to open the last dispensation,\u201d and we are blessed that he did.\nThe Lord commanded Oliver and all of us, \u201cStand by my servant Joseph, faithfully.\u201d I testify that the Lord stands by His servant Joseph and the Restoration wrought through him.\n\nJoseph Smith is now part of that heavenly priesthood of which he spoke. As he promised his friend, he is not far away from us, and on the other side of the veil, he is still working with us, and with a power greatly increased, to roll on this kingdom. With joy and thanksgiving, I raise my voice in \u201cpraise to the man who communed with Jehovah.\u201d And above all, praise to Jehovah, who communed with that man! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

In the April 2019 general conference, moments after I was sustained in my new responsibility as a General Authority Seventy, the choir sang a rendition of \u201cI Stand All Amazed\u201d that pierced my heart and soul.\n\n\nI marvel that he would descend from his throne divine\nTo rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine,\nThat he should extend his great love unto such as I,\nSufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.\n\n\nAs I heard those words, I was all amazed. I felt that despite my inadequacies and flaws, the Lord blessed me to know that \u201cin his strength I can do all things.\u201d\nThe common feeling of inadequacy, weakness, or even unworthiness is something with which many of us sometimes struggle. I still struggle with this; I felt it the day I was called. I have felt it many times, and I still feel it right now speaking to you. However, I have learned that I am not alone with these feelings. In fact, there are many accounts in the scriptures of those who seem to have felt similar feelings. For example, we remember Nephi as a faithful and valiant servant of the Lord. At times, even he struggled with feelings of unworthiness, weakness, and inadequacy.\nHe said: \u201cNotwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.\u201d\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith spoke of often feeling \u201ccondemned,\u201d in his youth, \u201cfor [his] weakness and imperfections.\u201d But Joseph\u2019s feelings of inadequacy and worry were part of what led him to ponder, study, learn, and pray. As you may remember, he went to pray in the grove near his home to find truth, peace, and forgiveness. He heard the Lord say: \u201cJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of Glory. I was crucified for the world that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life.\u201d\nJoseph\u2019s sincere desire to repent and seek the salvation of his soul helped him come to Jesus Christ and receive forgiveness of his sins. This continuous effort opened the door to the continuing Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nThis remarkable experience of the Prophet Joseph Smith illustrates how feelings of weakness and inadequacy can help us recognize our fallen nature. If we are humble, this will help us come to recognize our dependence upon Jesus Christ and stir within our hearts a sincere desire to turn to the Savior and repent of our sins.\nMy friends, repentance is joy! Sweet repentance is part of a daily process through which, \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept,\u201d the Lord teaches us to live a life centered in His teachings. Like Joseph and Nephi, we can \u201ccry unto [God] for mercy; for he is mighty to save.\u201d He can fulfill any righteous desire or longing and can heal any wound in our lives.\nIn the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, you and I can find countless accounts of individuals who learned how to come unto Christ through sincere repentance.\nI\u2019d like to share with you an example of the tender mercies of the Lord through an experience that occurred in my beloved home island of Puerto Rico.\nIt was in my hometown of Ponce that a sister in the Church, C\u00e9lia Cruz Ayala, decided that she was going to give a Book of Mormon to a friend. She wrapped it and went to deliver this gift, more precious to her than diamonds or rubies, she said. On her way, a thief approached her, grabbed her purse, and ran away with the special gift inside.\nWhen she told this story at church, her friend said, \u201cWho knows? Maybe this was your opportunity to share the gospel!\u201d\nWell, a few days later, do you know what happened? C\u00e9lia received a letter. I hold that letter, which C\u00e9lia shared with me, in my hand today. It says:\n\u201cMrs. Cruz:\n\u201cForgive me, forgive me. You will never know how sorry I am for attacking you. But because of it, my life has changed and will continue to change.\n\u201cThat book [the Book of Mormon] has helped me in my life. The dream of that man of God has shaken me. \u2026 I am returning your five [dollars,] for I can\u2019t spend them. I want you to know that you seemed to have a radiance about you. That light seemed to stop me [from harming you, so] I ran away instead.\n\u201cI want you to know that you will see me again, but when you do, you won\u2019t recognize me, for I will be your brother. \u2026 Here, where I live, I have to find the Lord and go to the church you belong to.\n\u201cThe message you wrote in that book brought tears to my eyes. Since Wednesday night I have not been able to stop reading it. I have prayed and asked God to forgive me [and] I ask you to forgive me. \u2026 I thought your wrapped gift was something I could sell. [Instead,] it has made me want to [change] my life. \u2026 Forgive me, forgive me, I beg you.\n\u201cYour absent friend.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, the light of the Savior can reach us all, no matter our circumstances. \u201cIt is not possible for you to sink lower than the infinite light of Christ\u2019s Atonement shines,\u201d said President Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland.\nAs for the unintended recipient of C\u00e9lia\u2019s gift, the Book of Mormon, this brother went on to witness more of the Lord\u2019s mercy. Although it took time for this brother to forgive himself, he found joy in repentance. What a miracle! One faithful sister, one Book of Mormon, sincere repentance, and the Savior\u2019s power led to the enjoyment of the fulness of blessings of the gospel and sacred covenants in the house of the Lord. Other family members followed and accepted sacred responsibilities in the Lord\u2019s vineyard, including full-time missionary service.\nAs we come unto Jesus Christ, our path of sincere repentance will eventually lead us to the Savior\u2019s holy temple.\nWhat a righteous motive to strive to be clean\u2014to be worthy of the fulness of the blessings made possible by our Heavenly Father and His Son through sacred temple covenants! Serving regularly in the house of the Lord and striving to keep the sacred covenants we make there will increase both our desire and our ability to experience the change of heart, might, mind, and soul necessary for us to become more like our Savior. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has testified: \u201cNothing will open the heavens *more* [than worshipping in the temple]. Nothing!\u201d\nMy dear friends, do you feel inadequate? Do you feel unworthy? Are you second-guessing yourself? Perhaps you might worry and ask: Do I measure up? Is it too late for me? Why do I keep failing when I am trying my absolute best?\nBrothers and sisters, surely we will make mistakes in our lives along the way. But please remember that, as Elder Gerrit&nbsp;W. Gong has taught: \u201cOur Savior\u2019s Atonement is infinite and eternal. Each of us strays and falls short. We may, for a time, lose our way. God lovingly assures us [that] no matter where we are or what we have done, there is no point of no return. He waits ready to embrace us.\u201d\nAs my dear wife, Cari Lu, has also taught me, we all need to repent, rewind, and reset the time to \u201czero o\u2019clock\u201d every single day.\nObstacles will come. Let us not wait for things to get hard before turning to God. Let us not wait until the end of our mortal lives to truly repent. Instead, let us now, no matter which part of the covenant path we are on, focus on the redemptive power of Jesus Christ and on Heavenly Father\u2019s desire for us to return to Him.\nThe Lord\u2019s house, His holy scriptures, His holy prophets and apostles inspire us to strive towards personal holiness through the doctrine of Christ.\nAnd Nephi said: \u201cAnd now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man [and woman] can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d\nOur process of \u201cat-one-ment\u201d with God may feel challenging. But you and I can pause, be still, look to the Savior, and seek to find and act on what He would have us change. If we do so with full intent, we will witness His healing. And think of how our posterity will be blessed as we embrace the Lord\u2019s gift of repentance!\nThe Master Potter, taught my dad, will mold and refine us, which can be difficult. Nonetheless, the Master Healer will also cleanse us. I have experienced and continue to experience that healing power. I testify that it comes through faith in Jesus Christ and daily repentance.\n\n\nOh, it is wonderful that he should care for me\nEnough to die for me!\n\n\nI testify of God\u2019s love and of the infinite power of His Son\u2019s Atonement. We can feel it profoundly as we sincerely and wholeheartedly repent.\nMy friends, I am a witness of the glorious Restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith and the current divine guidance of the Savior through His prophet and mouthpiece, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson. I know Jesus Christ lives and that He is the Master Healer of our souls. I know and I testify that these things are true, in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

You are devoted disciples of Jesus Christ who are eager to learn. I commend you for your faithfulness. And I love you.\nEzra Taft Benson served as the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from November 1985 until May 1994. I was 33 years old when President Benson became the President of the Church and 42 when he passed away. And his teachings and testimony influenced me in profound and powerful ways.\nOne of the hallmarks of President Benson\u2019s ministry was his focus upon the purpose and importance of the Book of Mormon. He emphasized repeatedly that \u201cthe Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion\u2014the keystone of our testimony, the keystone of our doctrine, and the keystone in the witness of our Lord and Savior.\u201d He also often emphasized teachings and warnings about the sin of pride found in this latter-day testament of Jesus Christ.\nA particular teaching by President Benson greatly impacted me and continues to influence my study of the Book of Mormon. He said:\n\u201cThe Book of Mormon \u2026 was written for our day. The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us. Mormon wrote near the end of the Nephite civilization. Under the inspiration of God, who sees all things from the beginning, [Mormon] abridged centuries of records, choosing the stories, speeches, and events that would be most helpful to us.\u201d\nPresident Benson continued: \u201cEach of the major writers of the Book of Mormon testified that he wrote for future generations. \u2026 If they saw our day, and chose those things which would be of greatest worth to us, is not that how we should study the Book of Mormon? We should constantly ask ourselves, \u2018Why did the Lord inspire Mormon \u2026 to include [this account] in his record? What lesson can I learn from [this admonition] to help me live in this day and age?\u2019\u201d\nPresident Benson\u2019s statements help us to understand that the Book of Mormon is not primarily a historical record that looks to the past. Rather, this volume of scripture looks to the future and contains important principles, warnings, and lessons intended for the circumstances and challenges of our day. Hence, the Book of Mormon is a book about our future and the times in which we do now and will yet live.\nI pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we now consider relevant lessons for us today from the book of Helaman in the Book of Mormon.\n\n\nThe Nephites and the Lamanites\n\nThe record of Helaman and his sons describes a people who were anticipating the birth of Jesus Christ. The half century recounted in the scriptural record highlights the conversion and righteousness of the Lamanites and the wickedness, apostasy, and abominations of the Nephites.\nA series of comparisons and contrasts between the Nephites and Lamanites from this ancient record are most instructive for us today.\n\u201cThe Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness and their steadiness in the faith.\n\u201c[And] there were many of the Nephites who had become hardened and impenitent and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of God and all the preaching and prophesying which did come among them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.\n\u201cAnd thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.\n\n\u201cAnd thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words.\u201d\nPerhaps the most stunning and sobering aspect of this decline into apostasy by the Nephites is the fact that \u201call these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Nephites Turned Away from God\n\nHow could a once-righteous people become hardened and wicked in such a short period of time? How could people so quickly forget the God who had blessed them so abundantly?\nIn a powerful and profound way, the negative example of the Nephites is instructive for us today.\n\u201cPride \u2026 began to enter \u2026 into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God \u2026 because of their exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land.\u201d\n\u201c[They] set [their] hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world\u201d \u201cbecause of that pride which [they] \u2026 suffered to enter [into their] hearts, which \u2026 lifted [them] up beyond that which is good because of [their] exceedingly great riches!\u201d\nAncient voices from the dust plead with us today to learn this everlasting lesson: prosperity, possessions, and ease constitute a potent mixture that can lead even the righteous to drink the spiritual poison of pride.\nAllowing pride to enter into our hearts can cause us to mock that which is sacred; disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and revelation; trample under our feet the commandments of God; deny the word of God; cast out, mock, and revile against the prophets; and forget the Lord our God and \u201cnot desire that the Lord [our] God, who hath created [us], should rule and reign over [us].\u201d\nTherefore, if we are not faithful and obedient, we can transform the God-given blessing of prosperity into a prideful curse that diverts and distracts us from eternal truths and vital spiritual priorities. We always must be on guard against a pride-induced and exaggerated sense of self-importance, a misguided evaluation of our own self-sufficiency, and seeking self instead of serving others.\nAs we pridefully focus upon ourselves, we also are afflicted with spiritual blindness and miss much, most, or perhaps all that is occurring within and around us. We cannot look to and focus upon Jesus Christ as the \u201cmark\u201d if we only see ourselves.\nSuch spiritual blindness also can cause us to turn out of the way of righteousness, fall away into forbidden paths, and become lost. As we blindly \u201cturn unto [our] own ways\u201d and follow destructive detours, we are inclined to lean upon our own understanding, boast in our own strength, and depend upon our own wisdom.\nSamuel the Lamanite succinctly summarized the turning away from God by the Nephites: \u201cYe have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.\u201d\nThe prophet Mormon observed, \u201cThe more part of the people [remained] in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part [walked] more circumspectly before God.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Lamanites Turned to God\n\nIn the Book of Helaman, the increasing righteousness of the Lamanites provides a stark contrast to the rapid spiritual decline of the Nephites.\nThe Lamanites turned to God and were brought to a knowledge of the truth by believing the teachings in the holy scriptures and of prophets, exercising faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repenting of their sins, and experiencing a mighty change of heart.\n\u201cTherefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.\u201d\n\u201cYe should behold that the more part of [the Lamanites] are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026 They are striving with unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the truth.\u201d\nAs a consequence, the \u201crighteousness [of the Lamanites] did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness and their steadiness in the faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Warning and a Promise\n\nMoroni declared: \u201cBehold, the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that which must shortly come, at that day when these things shall come forth among you.\n\u201cBehold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.\u201d\nPlease remember that the Book of Mormon looks to the future and contains important principles, warnings, and lessons intended for me and you in the circumstances and challenges of our present day.\nApostasy can occur at two basic levels\u2014institutional and individual. At the institutional level, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will not be lost through apostasy or taken from the earth.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith proclaimed: \u201cThe Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing \u2026&nbsp;; the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.\u201d\nAt the individual level, each of us must \u201cbeware of pride, lest [we] become as the Nephites of old.\u201d\nMay I suggest that if you or I believe we are sufficiently strong and stalwart to avoid the arrogance of pride, then perhaps we already are suffering from this deadly spiritual disease. Simply stated, if you or I do not believe we could be afflicted with and by pride, then we are vulnerable and in spiritual danger. In the space of not many days, weeks, months, or years, we might forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage.\nIf, however, you or I believe we could be afflicted with and by pride, then we consistently will do the small and simple things that will protect and help us become \u201cas a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us].\u201d \u201cBlessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble.\u201d\nAs we follow President Benson\u2019s counsel and ask ourselves why the Lord inspired Mormon to include in his abridgment of the book of Helaman the accounts, admonitions, and warnings that he did, I promise we will discern the applicability of these teachings to the specific conditions of our individual lives and families today. As we study and ponder this inspired record, we will be blessed with eyes to see, ears to hear, minds to comprehend, and hearts to understand the lessons we should learn to \u201cbeware of pride, lest [we should] enter into temptation.\u201d\nI joyfully witness that God the Eternal Father is our Father. Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten and Beloved Son. He is our Savior. And I testify that as we walk in the meekness of the Lord\u2019s Spirit, we will avoid and overcome pride and have peace in Him. I so witness in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "It is the Sabbath day, and we have gathered to speak of Christ and Him crucified. I know that my Redeemer lives.\nConsider this scene from the last week of Jesus\u2019s mortal life. A multitude had gathered, including Roman soldiers armed with staves and strapped with swords. Led by officers from the chief priests who had torches in hand, this earnest company was *not* off to conquer a city. Tonight they were looking for only one man, a man not known to carry a weapon, receive military training, or engage in physical combat at any time in His entire life.\nAs the soldiers approached, Jesus, in an effort to protect His disciples, stepped forth and said, \u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d They replied, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cI am he. \u2026 As soon \u2026 as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.\u201d\nTo me, that is one of the most stirring lines in all of scripture. Among other things, it tells me straightforwardly that *just being in the presence* of the Son of God\u2014the great Jehovah of the Old Testament and Good Shepherd of the New, who bears no weapons of any kind\u2014that *just hearing the voice* of this Refuge from the Storm, this Prince of Peace, is enough to send antagonists stumbling into retreat, piling them in a jumble, making the whole group wish they had been assigned kitchen duty that night.\nJust a few days earlier, when He had entered the city triumphantly, \u201call the city was moved,\u201d the scripture says, asking, \u201cWho is this?\u201d I can only imagine that \u201cWho is this?\u201d is the question those muddled soldiers were now asking!\nThe *answer* to that question could not have been in His looks, for Isaiah had prophesied some seven centuries earlier that \u201che hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.\u201d It certainly wasn\u2019t in His polished wardrobe or His great personal wealth, of which He had neither. It could not be from any professional training in the local synagogues because we have no evidence that He ever studied at any of them, though even in His youth He could confound superbly prepared scribes and lawyers, astonishing them with His doctrine \u201cas one having authority.\u201d\nFrom that teaching in the temple to His triumphant entry into Jerusalem and this final, unjustifiable arrest, Jesus was routinely placed in difficult, often devious situations in which He was always triumphant\u2014victories for which we have no explanation except divine DNA.\nYet down through history many have simplified, even trivialized our image of Him and His witness of who He was. They have reduced His righteousness to mere prudishness, His justice to mere anger, His mercy to mere permissiveness. We must not be guilty of such simplistic versions of Him that conveniently ignore teachings we find uncomfortable. This \u201cdumbing down\u201d has been true even regarding His ultimate defining virtue, His love.\nDuring His mortal mission, Jesus taught that there were two great commandments. They have been taught in this conference and will forever be taught: \u201cLove the Lord thy God [and] love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d&nbsp;If we are to follow the Savior faithfully in these two crucial and inextricably linked rules, we ought to hold firmly to what He *actually* said. And what He *actually* said was, \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments.\u201d On that same evening, He said we were to \u201clove one another; as I have loved you.\u201d\nIn those scriptures, those qualifying phrases defining true, Christlike love\u2014sometimes referred to as charity\u2014are absolutely essential.\nWhat do they define? How did Jesus love?\nFirst, He loved with \u201call [of His] heart, might, mind and strength,\u201d giving Him the ability to heal the deepest pain and declare the hardest reality. In short, He is one who could administer grace and insist on truth at the same time. As Lehi said in his blessing to his son Jacob, \u201cRedemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.\u201d His love allows an encouraging embrace when it is needed and a bitter cup when it has to be swallowed. So we try to love\u2014with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength\u2014because that is the way He loves us.\nThe second characteristic of Jesus\u2019s divine charity was His obedience to *every word* that proceeded from God\u2019s mouth, always aligning His will and behavior with that of His Heavenly Father.\nWhen He arrived on the Western Hemisphere following His Resurrection, Christ said to the Nephites: \u201cBehold, I am Jesus Christ. \u2026 I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, \u2026 in the which I have suffered the will of the Father \u2026 from the beginning.\u201d\nOf the myriad ways He could have introduced Himself, Jesus did so *by declaring His obedience to the will of the Father*\u2014never mind that not long before in His hour of greatest need, this Only Begotten Son of God had felt totally abandoned by His Father. Christ\u2019s charity\u2014*evident in complete loyalty to divine will*\u2014persisted and continues to persist, not just through the easy and comfortable days but especially through the darkest and most difficult ones.\nJesus was \u201ca man of sorrows,\u201d the scriptures say. He experienced sadness, fatigue, disappointment, and excruciating loneliness. In these and in all times, Jesus\u2019s love faileth not, and neither does His Father\u2019s. With such mature love\u2014the kind that exemplifies, empowers, and imparts\u2014ours will not fail either.\nSo, if sometimes the harder you try, the more difficult it seems to get; if, just as you try to work on your limitations and your shortcomings, you find someone or something determined to challenge your faith; if, as you labor devotedly, you still feel moments of fear wash over you, remember that it has been so for some of the most faithful and marvelous people in every era of time. Also remember that there is a force in the universe determined to oppose *every good thing* you try to do.\nSo, through abundance as well as poverty, through private acclaim as well as public criticism, through the divine elements of the Restoration as well as the human foibles that will inevitably be part of it, *we stay the course with* the true Church of Christ. Why? Because as with our Redeemer, we signed on for the whole term\u2014not ending with the first short introductory quiz but through to the final exam. The joy in this is that the Headmaster gave us all open-book answers *before the course began*. Furthermore, we have a host of tutors who remind us of these answers at regular stops along the way. But of course, none of this works if we keep cutting class.\n\u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d With all our hearts we answer, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d When He says, \u201cI am he,\u201d we bow our knee and confess with our tongue that He is the living Christ, that He alone atoned for our sins, that He was carrying us even when we thought He had abandoned us. When we stand before Him and see the wounds in His hands and feet, we will begin to comprehend what it meant for Him *to bear our sins and be acquainted with grief, to be completely obedient to the will of His Father*\u2014all out of pure love for us. To introduce others to faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and receiving our blessings in the house of the Lord\u2014these are the fundamental \u201cprinciples and ordinances\u201d that ultimately reveal our love of God and neighbor and joyfully characterize the true Church of Christ.\nBrothers and sisters, I testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the vehicle God has provided for our exaltation. The gospel it teaches is true, and the priesthood legitimizing it is not derivative. I testify that Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson is a prophet of our God, as His predecessors were and as His successors will be. And one day that prophetic guidance will lead a generation to see our Messenger of Salvation descend like \u201clightning \u2026 out of the east,\u201d and we will exclaim, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d With arms forever outstretched and love unfeigned, He will reply, \u201cI am he.\u201d I so promise with the apostolic power and authority of His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "I know this may come as a surprise, but I\u2019m old enough to remember when we were taught in school that there were nine planets in our solar system. One of those planets, Pluto, was given its name by 11-year-old Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, after its discovery in 1930. And up until 1992, Pluto was believed to be the most distant object in our solar system. During this time, it was common to find childhood papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 models of our planetary neighborhood in classrooms and science fairs, each one illustrating Pluto\u2019s position on the known border. Many scientists believed that beyond that edge, the outer solar system consisted of empty space.\nHowever, a lingering question remained within the scientific community regarding the origin of a particular type of comet that astronomers regularly tracked. And that question persisted for decades before the discovery of another distant region of our solar system. With the limited knowledge they had, scientists used those intervening decades to produce significant technological advances that allowed for further study and exploration. Their eventual breakthrough reconfigured our planetary zone and resulted in Pluto being rehomed to this new region of space and our solar system consisting of eight planets.\nOne leading planetary scientist and principal investigator for the New Horizons space mission tasked with exploring Pluto up close had this to say about this experience: \u201cWe thought we understood the geography of our solar system. We didn\u2019t. We thought we understood the population of planets in our solar system. And we were wrong.\u201d\nWhat is striking to me about this period of space exploration history are some parallels and key distinctions between the metaphorical pursuit of expanding scientific horizons and the journey that we, as children of God, undertake to seek answers to our spiritual questions. Specifically, how we can respond to the limits of our spiritual understanding and prepare ourselves for the next stage of personal growth\u2014and where we can turn for help.\n\n\nLine upon Line\n\nAsking questions and searching for meaning are a natural and normal part of our mortal experience. At times, not readily having complete answers can bring us to the edge of our understanding, and those limitations can feel frustrating or overwhelming. Wondrously, Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of happiness for all of us is designed to help us progress despite our limitations and accomplish what we cannot accomplish on our own, *even without a complete knowledge of all things*. God\u2019s plan is merciful toward the limitations of our humanity; provides us with our Savior, Jesus Christ, to be our Good Shepherd; and inspires us to use our agency to choose Him.\nElder Dieter&nbsp;F. Uchtdorf has taught that \u201casking questions isn\u2019t a sign of weakness,\u201d but rather \u201cit\u2019s a precursor of growth.\u201d Speaking directly to our personal effort as seekers of truth, our prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, has taught that we must have \u201ca deep desire\u201d and \u201cask with a sincere heart [and] real intent, having faith in [Jesus] Christ.\u201d He has further taught that \u201c\u2018real intent\u2019 means that one *really intends* to follow the divine direction given.\u201d\nOur personal effort to grow in wisdom may lead us to examine our questions, complex or otherwise, through the lens of cause and effect, seeking out and recognizing patterns and then forming narratives to give shape to our understanding and fill in perceived gaps in knowledge. When we consider our pursuit of spiritual knowledge, however, these thoughtful processes may be helpful at times but on their own can be incomplete as we look to discern things pertaining to Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ, Their gospel, Their Church, and Their plan for all of us.\nGod the Father and His Son\u2019s way of imparting Their wisdom to us prioritizes inviting the power of the Holy Ghost to be our personal teacher as we center Jesus Christ in our lives and in our faithful seeking for Their answers and Their meaning. They invite us to discover truth through devoted time spent studying holy scripture and to seek for latter-day revealed truth for our day and our time, imparted by modern-day prophets and apostles. They entreat us to spend regular, worshipful time in the house of the Lord and to take to our knees in prayer \u201cto access information from heaven.\u201d Jesus\u2019s promise to those present to hear His Sermon on the Mount is as true for us in our day as it was during His earthly ministry: \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\u201d Our Savior assures that \u201cyour Father which is in heaven give[s] good things to them that ask him.\u201d\nThe Lord\u2019s method of teaching is \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept.\u201d We may be required to \u201cwait upon the Lord\u201d in the space between our current line of understanding and the next yet to be delivered. This sacred space can be a place where our greatest spiritual conditioning can occur\u2014the site where we can \u201cbear with patience\u201d our earnest seeking and renew our strength to continue to keep the sacred promises we have made to God through covenant.\nOur covenant relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ signals our prevailing citizenship in God\u2019s kingdom. And our residency therein requires aligning our life to divine principles and putting in the effort to grow spiritually.\n\n\n\nObedience\n\nOne key principle taught throughout the Book of Mormon is when God\u2019s children choose to demonstrate obedience and keep their covenants, they receive continual spiritual guidance and direction. The Lord has told us that through our obedience and diligence, we may gain knowledge and intelligence. God\u2019s laws and commandments are not designed to be an obstacle in our life but a powerful gateway to personal revelation and spiritual education. President Nelson has taught the crucial truth that \u201crevelation from God is always compatible with His eternal law\u201d and further that \u201cit never contradicts His doctrine.\u201d Your willing obedience to God\u2019s commands, despite not having a complete knowledge of His reasons, places you in the company of His prophets. Moses&nbsp;5 teaches us about a particular interaction between Adam and an angel of the Lord.\nAfter the Lord gave Adam and Eve \u201ccommandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord,\u201d the scriptures say that \u201cAdam was *obedient* unto the commandments of the Lord.\u201d We go on to read that \u201cafter many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: *I know not, save the Lord commanded me.*\u201d\nAdam\u2019s obedience *preceded* his understanding and* prepared* him to receive the *sacred knowledge* that he was participating in a *sacred symbol* of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Our humble obedience will, likewise, pave the way for our spiritual discernment of God\u2019s ways and His divine purpose for each of us. Reaching to elevate our obedience brings us closer to our Savior, Jesus Christ, because obedience to His laws and commandments is effectually reaching out to Him.\nAdditionally, our fidelity to the knowledge and wisdom we have *already inherited* through our faithful adherence to gospel principles and sacred covenants is crucial preparation for our readiness to receive and be stewards of communications from the Holy Spirit.\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ are the source of all truth and share Their wisdom liberally. Also, understanding that we do not possess any personal knowledge independent of God can help us know who to turn to and where to place our primary trust.\n\n\n\nProfound Trust\n\nThe Old Testament account of Naaman, the military leader who was healed of leprosy by the prophet Elisha, is a particular favorite of mine. The story illustrates how the firm faith of a \u201clittle maid\u201d altered the course of one man\u2019s life and, for all believers, revealed the reach of God\u2019s mercy to those who place their trust in Him and His prophet. Though nameless, this young girl also helped to push our understanding forward. And Naaman\u2019s belief on her testimony inspired him to take his petition for healing to God\u2019s chosen servant.\nNaaman\u2019s response to the prophet Elisha\u2019s instructions to wash in the river Jordan was at first skeptical and indignant. But an invitation for him to be *obedient* to the prophet\u2019s counsel made way for his healing and his dramatic understanding that God was real.\nWe may find that some of our spiritual petitions have reasonably discernible answers and may not create significant discomfort for us. Or, like Naaman, we may find that other needs are more challenging and may create difficult and complex feelings within us. Or, similar to the description of the astronomers\u2019 early conclusions about our solar system, in our search for *spiritual truth*, we may reach less accurate interpretations if we rely exclusively on our own limited understanding, a sorrowful and unintended consequence of which may lead us away from the covenant path. And moreover, some questions may persist until God, who \u201chas all power\u201d and \u201call wisdom, and all understanding,\u201d who \u201ccomprehendeth all things\u201d in His mercy, provides enlightenment through our belief on His name.\nOne significant caution from Naaman\u2019s account is that resisting obedience to God\u2019s laws and commandments may prolong or delay our growth. We are blessed to have Jesus Christ as our Master Healer. Our obedience to God\u2019s laws and commandments can open the way for our Savior to provide the understanding and healing He knows we need, according to His prescribed treatment plan for us.\nElder Richard&nbsp;G. Scott taught that \u201cthis life is an experience in profound trust\u2014trust in Jesus Christ, trust in His teachings, trust in our capacity as led by the Holy Spirit to obey those teachings for happiness now and for a purposeful, supremely happy eternal existence. To trust means to obey willingly without knowing the end from the beginning (see [[Proverbs 3|Prov. 3:5\u20137]]). To produce fruit, your trust in the Lord must be more powerful and enduring than your confidence in your own personal feelings and experience.\u201d\nElder Scott continues: \u201cTo exercise faith is to trust that the Lord knows what He is doing with you and that He can accomplish it for your eternal good even though you cannot understand how He can possibly do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nClosing Testimony\n\nDear friends, I testify that our sincere gospel questions can provide Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ with opportunities to help us grow. My personal effort to seek answers from the Lord to my own spiritual questions\u2014past and present\u2014has allowed me to use the space between the lines of my understanding and God\u2019s to practice obedience to Him and fidelity to the spiritual knowledge that I currently possess.\nI testify that placing your trust in Heavenly Father and in His prophets, whom He has sent, will help you to spiritually elevate and push you forward toward God\u2019s expanded horizon. Your vantage will change because you will change. God knows that the higher you are, the farther you can see. Our Savior invites you to make that climb. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

One of those planets, Pluto, was given its name by 11-year-old Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, after its discovery in 1930. And up until 1992, Pluto was believed to be the most distant object in our solar system. During this time, it was common to find childhood papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 models of our planetary neighborhood in classrooms and science fairs, each one illustrating Pluto\u2019s position on the known border. Many scientists believed that beyond that edge, the outer solar system consisted of empty space."

With the limited knowledge they had, scientists used those intervening decades to produce significant technological advances that allowed for further study and exploration. Their eventual breakthrough reconfigured our planetary zone and resulted in Pluto being rehomed to this new region of space and our solar system consisting of eight planets."

        "full_markdown": "For several years I was assigned to home teach an older sister in my ward. She did not have an easy life. She had various health problems and experienced a lifetime of pain due to a childhood accident on the playground. Divorced at age 32 with four young children to raise and provide for, she remarried at age 50. Her second husband passed away when she was 66, and this sister lived an additional 26 years as a widow.\nDespite her lifelong challenges, she was faithful to her covenants to the end. This sister was an avid genealogist, a temple attender, and a collector and writer of family histories. Though she had many difficult trials, and without question she felt at times sadness and loneliness, she had a cheerful countenance and a gracious and pleasant personality.\nNine months after her passing, one of her sons had a remarkable experience in the temple. He learned by the power of the Holy Ghost that his mother had a message for him. She communicated with him, but not by vision or audible words. The following unmistakable message came into the son\u2019s mind from his mother: \u201cI want you to know that mortality works, and I want you to know that I now understand why everything happened [in my life] the way it did\u2014and it is all OK.\u201d\nThis message is all the more remarkable when one considers her situation and the difficulties this sister endured and overcame.\nBrothers and sisters, mortality works! It is designed to work! Despite the challenges, heartaches, and difficulties we all face, our loving, wise, and perfect Heavenly Father has designed the plan of happiness such that we are not destined to fail. His plan provides a way for us to rise above our mortal failures. The Lord has said, \u201cThis is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\u201d\nNonetheless, if we are to be the beneficiaries of the Lord\u2019s \u201cwork and \u2026 glory,\u201d even \u201cimmortality and eternal life,\u201d we must expect to be schooled and taught and to pass through the refiner\u2019s fire\u2014sometimes to our utter limits. To completely avoid the problems, challenges, and difficulties of this world would be to sidestep the process that is truly necessary for mortality to work.\nAnd so we should not be surprised when hard times come upon us. We will encounter situations that try us and people who enable us to practice true charity and patience. But we need to bear up under our difficulties and remember, as the Lord said:\n\u201cAnd whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name\u2019s sake, shall find it again, even life eternal.\n\u201cTherefore, be not afraid of your enemies [or your problems, challenges, or the tests of this life], for I have decreed&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant \u2026 that you may be found worthy.\u201d\nWhen we feel distraught or anxious about our problems or feel that we might be receiving more than our fair share of life\u2019s difficulties, we can remember what the Lord said to the children of Israel:\n\u201cAnd thou shalt remember all the way[s] which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what [is] in thine heart, whether thou [would] keep his commandments, or no.\u201d\nAs Lehi taught his son Jacob:\n\u201cThou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow. \u2026 Nevertheless, \u2026 [God] shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain. \u2026 Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer.\u201d\nBecause this life is a testing ground and \u201cdark clouds of trouble hang o\u2019er us and threaten our peace to destroy,\u201d it is helpful to remember this counsel and promise found in [[Mosiah 23|Mosiah 23]] relating to life\u2019s challenges: \u201cNevertheless\u2014whosoever putteth his trust in [the Lord] the same shall be lifted up at the last day.\u201d\nAs a youth, I personally experienced great emotional pain and shame that came as the result of the unrighteous actions of another, which for many years affected my self-worth and my sense of worthiness before the Lord. Nevertheless, I bear personal witness that the Lord can strengthen us and bear us up in whatever difficulties we are called upon to experience during our sojourn in this vale of tears.\nWe are familiar with Paul\u2019s experience:\n\u201cAnd lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations [I have received], there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.\n\u201cFor this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.\n\u201cAnd he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t know what Paul\u2019s \u201cthorn in the flesh\u201d was. He chose not to describe whether it was a physical ailment, a mental or emotional infirmity, or a temptation. But we don\u2019t need to know that detail to know that he struggled and pleaded with the Lord for help and that, ultimately, the Lord\u2019s strength and power are what helped him through it.\nLike it was for Paul, it was through the Lord\u2019s help that I was eventually strengthened emotionally and spiritually and finally recognized after many years that I have always been a person of worth and worthy of the blessings of the gospel. The Savior helped me to overcome my feelings of unworthiness and to extend sincere forgiveness to the offender. I finally understood that the Savior\u2019s Atonement was a personal gift for me and that my Heavenly Father and His Son love me perfectly. Because of the Savior\u2019s Atonement, mortality works.\nWhile I was eventually blessed to recognize how the Savior rescued me and stood by me through those experiences, I clearly understand that the unfortunate situation of my teenage years was *my* personal journey and experience, the resolution of which and eventual outcome cannot be projected onto those who have suffered and continue to suffer from the unrighteous behavior of others.\nI recognize that life\u2019s experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014can teach us important lessons. I now know and bear testimony that mortality works! I hope that as a result of the sum of my life\u2019s experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014I have compassion for innocent victims of another\u2019s actions and empathy for the downtrodden.\nI sincerely hope that as a result of my life\u2019s experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014I am kinder to others, treat others as the Savior would, and have greater understanding for the sinner and that I have complete integrity. As we come to rely on the Savior\u2019s grace and keep our covenants, we can serve as examples of the far-reaching effects of the Savior\u2019s Atonement.\nI share a final example that mortality works.\n\n\n\nElder Hales\u2019s aunt, Lois VandenBosch, and his mother, Klea VandenBosch.\n\n\nMy mother did not have an easy journey through mortality. She received no accolades or worldly honors and did not have educational opportunities beyond high school. She contracted polio as a child, resulting in a lifetime of pain and discomfort in her left leg. As an adult, she experienced many difficult and challenging physical and financial circumstances but was faithful to her covenants and loved the Lord.\nWhen my mother was 55, my next older sister passed away, leaving an eight-month-old baby daughter, my niece, motherless. For various reasons, Mom ended up largely raising my niece for the next 17 years, often under very trying circumstances. Yet, notwithstanding these experiences, she happily and willingly served her family, neighbors, and ward members and served as an ordinance worker in the temple for many years. During the last several years of her life, Mom suffered from a form of dementia, was often confused, and was confined to a nursing facility. Regrettably, she was alone when she passed away unexpectedly.\nSeveral months after her passing, I had a dream I have never forgotten. In my dream, I was sitting in my office at the Church Administration Building. Mom entered the office. I knew she had come from the spirit world. I will always remember the feelings I had. She did not say anything, but she radiated a spiritual beauty that I had never before experienced and which I have difficulty describing.\nHer countenance and being were truly stunning! I remember saying to her, \u201cMother, you are so beautiful!,\u201d referencing her spiritual power and beauty. She acknowledged me\u2014again without speaking. I felt her love for me, and I knew then that she is happy and healed from her worldly cares and challenges and eagerly awaits \u201ca glorious resurrection.\u201d I know that for Mom, mortality worked\u2014and that it works for us too.\nGod\u2019s work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. The experiences of mortality are part of the journey that allows us to grow and progress toward that immortality and eternal life. We were not sent here to fail but to succeed in God\u2019s plan for us.\nAs King Benjamin taught: \u201cAnd moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.\u201d In other words, mortality works!\nI testify that as we receive the ordinances of the gospel, enter into covenants with God and then keep those covenants, repent, serve others, and endure to the end, we too can have the assurance and complete trust in the Lord that mortality works! I testify of Jesus Christ and that our glorious future with our Heavenly Father is made possible by the grace and Atonement of the Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Several years ago, my wife and I served as mission leaders in Tokyo, Japan. During a visit to our mission by then-Elder Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, one of the missionaries asked him how best to respond when a person tells them that they are too busy to listen to them. With little hesitation, Elder Nelson said, \u201cI would ask if they were too busy to eat lunch that day and then teach them that they have both a body and a spirit, and just as their body will die if not nourished, so will their spirit if not nourished by the good word of God.\u201d\nIt is interesting to note that the Japanese word for \u201cbusy,\u201d *isogashii*, is made up of a character with two symbols (\u5fd9). The one on the left means \u201cheart\u201d or \u201cspirit,\u201d and the one on the right means \u201cdeath\u201d\u2014suggesting perhaps, as President Nelson taught, that being too busy to nourish our spirits can lead us to die spiritually.\nThe Lord knew\u2014in this fast-paced world full of distractions and in commotion\u2014that making quality time for Him would be one of the major challenges of our day. Speaking through the prophet Isaiah, He provided these words of counsel and caution, which can be likened unto the tumultuous days in which we live:\n\u201cIn *returning* and *rest* shall ye be saved; in *quietness* and in *confidence* shall be your strength: and ye would not.\n\u201cBut ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.\u201d\nIn other words, even though our salvation depends on *returning* to Him often and *resting* from the cares of the world, we do not. And even though our *confidence* will come from a strength developed in *quiet* times sitting with the Lord in meditation and reflection, we do not. Why not? Because we say, \u201cNo, we are busy with other things\u201d\u2014fleeing upon our horses, so to speak. Therefore, we will get further and further away from God; we will insist on going faster and faster; and the faster we go, the swifter Satan will follow in pursuit.\nPerhaps this is why President Nelson has repeatedly pled with us to make time for the Lord in our lives\u2014\u201ceach and every day.\u201d He reminds us that \u201cquiet time is sacred time\u2014time that will facilitate personal revelation and instill peace.\u201d But to hear the still voice of the Lord, he counseled, \u201cyou too must be still.\u201d\nBeing still, however, requires more than just making time for the Lord\u2014it requires letting go of our doubtful and fearful thoughts and focusing our hearts and minds on Him. Elder David&nbsp;A. Bednar taught, \u201cThe Lord\u2019s admonition to \u2018be still\u2019 entails much more than simply not talking or not moving.\u201d To be still, he suggested, \u201cmay be a way of reminding us to focus upon the Savior unfailingly.\u201d\nBeing still is an act of faith and requires effort. Lectures on Faith states, \u201cWhen a man works by faith he works by mental exertion.\u201d President Nelson declared: \u201cOur focus must be riveted on the Savior and His gospel. It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him in *every* thought. But when we do, our doubts and fears flee.\u201d Speaking of this need to focus our minds, President David&nbsp;O. McKay said: \u201cI think we pay too little attention to the value of meditation, a principle of devotion. \u2026 Meditation is one of the \u2026 most sacred doors through which we pass into the presence of the Lord.\u201d\nThere is a word in Japanese, *mui*, that, for me, captures this more faith-filled, contemplative sense of what it means to be still. It is comprised of two characters (\u7121\u70ba). The one on the left means \u201cnothing\u201d or \u201cnothingness,\u201d and the one on the right means \u201cto do.\u201d Together they mean \u201cnon-doing.\u201d Taken literally, the word could be misinterpreted to mean \u201cto do nothing\u201d in the same way \u201cto be still\u201d can be misinterpreted as \u201cnot talking or moving.\u201d However, like the phrase \u201cto be still,\u201d it has a higher meaning; for me it is a reminder to slow down and to live with greater spiritual awareness.\nWhile serving in the Asia North Area Presidency with Elder Takashi Wada, I learned that his wife, Sister Naomi Wada, is an accomplished Japanese calligrapher. I asked Sister Wada if she would draw for me the Japanese characters for the word *mui*. I wanted to hang the calligraphy on my wall as a reminder to be still and to focus on the Savior. I was surprised when she did not readily agree to this seemingly simple request.\nThe next day, knowing that I had likely misunderstood her hesitance, Elder Wada explained that writing those characters would require a significant effort. She would need to ponder and meditate on the concept and the characters until she understood the meaning deeply in her soul and could give *expression* to these heartfelt *impressions* with each stroke of her brush. I was embarrassed that I had so casually asked her to do something so demanding. I asked him to convey my apologies to her for my ignorance and to let her know that I was withdrawing my request.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise and gratitude when upon my leaving Japan, Sister Wada, unsolicited, gifted to me this beautiful piece of calligraphy featuring the Japanese characters for the word *mui*. It now hangs prominently on the wall of my office, reminding me to be still and to seek the Lord every day with all my heart, might, mind, and strength. She had captured, in this selfless act, the meaning of *mui*, or stillness, better than any words could. Rather than mindlessly and dutifully drawing the characters, she approached her calligraphy with full purpose of heart and real intent.\nLikewise, God desires that we approach our time with Him with the same kind of heartfelt devotion. When we do so, our worship becomes an expression of our love for Him.\nHe yearns for us to commune with Him. On one occasion, after I gave the invocation in a meeting with the First Presidency, President Nelson turned to me and said, \u201cWhile you were praying, I thought how much God must appreciate when we take time from our busy schedules to acknowledge Him.\u201d It was a simple yet powerful reminder of how much it must mean to Heavenly Father when we pause to commune with Him.\nAs much as He desires our attention, He will not force us to come to Him. To the Nephites, the resurrected Lord said, \u201cHow oft *would I have* gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and *ye* would not.\u201d He followed that with this hopeful invitation that also applies to us today: \u201cHow oft *will* I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.\u201d\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ gives us opportunities to return to Him often. These opportunities include daily prayers, scripture study, the sacrament ordinance, the Sabbath day, and temple worship. What if we were to take these sacred opportunities off our to-do lists and put them on our \u201cnon-doing\u201d lists\u2014meaning to approach them with the same mindfulness and focus with which Sister Wada approaches her calligraphy?\nYou may be thinking, \u201cI do not have time for that.\u201d I have often felt the same. But let me suggest that what may be needed is not necessarily more time but more awareness of and focus on God during the times we already set aside for Him.\nFor example, when praying, what if we were to spend less time talking and more time just being with God; and when we were to speak, to give more heartfelt and specific expressions of gratitude and love?\nPresident Nelson has counseled that we not just read the scriptures but savor them. What difference would it make if we were to do less reading and more savoring?\nWhat if we were to do more to prepare our minds to partake of the sacrament and joyfully pondered the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ during this sacred ordinance?\nOn the Sabbath, which in Hebrew means \u201crest,\u201d what if we were to rest from other cares and to take time to sit quietly with the Lord to pay our devotions unto Him?\nDuring our temple worship, what if we were to make a more disciplined effort to pay attention or lingered a little longer in the celestial room in quiet reflection?\nWhen our focus is less on doing and more on strengthening our covenant connection with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, I testify that each of these sacred moments will be enriched, and we will receive the guidance needed in our personal lives. We, like Martha in the account in Luke, are often \u201ccareful and troubled about many things.\u201d However, as we commune with the Lord each day, He will help us to know that which is most needful.\nEven the Savior took time from His ministry to be still. The scriptures are replete with examples of the Lord retreating to a solitary place\u2014a mountain, the wilderness, a desert place, or going \u201ca little way off\u201d\u2014to pray to the Father. If Jesus Christ sought quiet time to commune with God and to be strengthened by Him, it would be wise for us to do the same.\nAs we concentrate our hearts and minds on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and listen to the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost, we will have greater clarity about what is most needful, develop deeper compassion, and find rest and strength in Him. Paradoxically, helping God hasten His work of salvation and exaltation may require that we slow down. Being always in motion may be adding to the commotion in our lives and robbing us of the peace we seek.\nI testify that as we return often to the Lord with full purpose of heart, we will in *quietness* and *confidence* come to know Him and feel His infinite covenantal love for us.\nThe Lord promised:\n\u201cDraw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.\u201d\nI testify that this promise is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

The one on the left means \u201cnothing\u201d or \u201cnothingness,\u201d and the one on the right means \u201cto do.\u201d Together they mean \u201cnon-doing.\u201d Taken literally, the word could be misinterpreted to mean \u201cto do nothing\u201d in the same way \u201cto be still\u201d can be misinterpreted as \u201cnot talking or moving.\u201d However, like the phrase \u201cto be still,\u201d it has a higher meaning; for me it is a reminder to slow down and to live with greater spiritual awareness."

        "full_markdown": "Introduction\n\n\u200bMy dear brothers and sisters, the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this dispensation is resplendent with divine experiences that demonstrate how the Lord has guided His Church. There is one decade in our history, however, that stands strikingly supreme above any other\u2014the decade from 1820 to 1830. Beginning with the Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s experience in the Sacred Grove in the spring of 1820, when he saw God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, and continuing until April&nbsp;6, 1830, that decade is unlike any other.\n\n\n\nConsider these remarkable events! The young prophet conversed with the angel Moroni, translated the gold plates, and published the Book of Mormon! He was the instrument through whom the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods were restored, and then he organized the Church! Oliver Cowdery described that era well: \u201cThese were days never to be forgotten.\u201d Miraculous events have continued to this very day.\nMay I be so bold as to suggest that this year we have commenced a decade that may prove to be as momentous as any that has followed that unparalleled founding decade almost two centuries ago.\n\n\n\nOur Decade\n\nLet me explain. Between now, 2024, and 2034, we will experience seminal events that will result in extraordinary opportunities to serve, to unite with members and friends, and to introduce The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to more people than ever before.\n\nWe just witnessed the power of a truly historic moment as we celebrated with tens of millions the 100th birthday of President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson.\nReporting on President Nelson\u2019s birthday, Newsweek wrote a headline that read, \u201cWorld\u2019s Oldest Religious Leader Turns 100.\u201d They then listed the world\u2019s 10 oldest faith leaders\u2014with President Nelson first on a list that included Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama.\nThis statement from a New York Times article represents the spirit of much of the international coverage: \u201cIn a [United States] presidential election cycle that has prompted soul-searching about aging and leadership, Mr. Nelson\u2019s milestone suggests that, at least in his church, a triple-digit birthday does not merit much hand-wringing. He remains a popular figure among church members, who view their president not just as an executive but as a \u2018prophet, seer, and revelator.\u2019\u201d\nHow grateful we are that President Nelson\u2019s landmark birthday gave us an opportunity to introduce a global audience to a prophet of God, a celebration *never to be forgotten*.\n\nEarlier this spring, a refurbished plaza on Temple Square\u2014featuring a display of international flags representing countries where the Church is recognized\u2014was unveiled. The plaza entrance is marked by a granite monument with these prophetic words: \u201cAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord\u2019s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.\u201d\nSurely, the monumental events that will occur during the next 10 years constitute one manifestation this prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled.\n\nContemplate the unprecedented number of temple open houses and dedications that are planned to take place over the next decade, even the potential of 164 temples and counting. Imagine tens of millions of you and your friends walking through a house of the Lord. The symbolic center of these events will be the rededication of the Salt Lake Temple and the activities associated with it. These certainly will be days never to be forgotten.\n\nThe year 2030 will bring opportunities worldwide to commemorate the bicentennial of the organization of the Church. Although it is too early to say how the Church will recognize this milestone, it will certainly allow us to invite family, friends, colleagues, and distinguished guests to \u201ccome and see\u201d and to better understand the powerful impact the Church has in the lives of Church members.\n\n\nIn 2034, thousands of dignitaries, visitors, and athletes from around the world will flood the streets of Salt Lake City, the stage for the Winter Olympic Games. There is perhaps no greater demonstration of worldwide unity than that embodied in the Olympic Games. The eyes of the world will be upon the Church and its members, affording a multitude of opportunities to volunteer, serve, and share glad tidings through kind deeds\u2014an event never to be forgotten.\nThese upcoming moments will provide members of the Church everywhere with increased opportunities to share the glad tidings of the gospel of Jesus Christ through word and deed, a decade never to be forgotten.\n\n\n\nGlad Tidings\n\nIn a meeting just weeks before his birthday, President Nelson shared the reason he cherishes the phrase \u201cglad tidings.\u201d On the face of it, he noted, the phrase rings of joy and happiness. But \u201cglad tidings\u201d conveys much more than that. He explained that this phrase comes from the original Greek word *euangelion*, which literally means the \u201cgood news\u201d or the \u201cgospel.\u201d Happiness and joy in this life and the next are always linked with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thus the phrase \u201cglad tidings\u201d captures this double meaning in a wonderful way.\n\u201cMen [and women] are, that they might have joy.\u201d Heavenly Father has provided the plan of happiness that enables joy through His blessings. These include living in His presence eternally as families. The Atonement of Jesus Christ is central to God\u2019s plan to redeem us. To receive eternal life, we must come unto Christ. As we do so \u201cand help others do the same, we participate in God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation.\u201d\nThis message of the glad tidings of the gospel of Jesus Christ is the most important message on earth. And that is where the youth and young adults of the Church come in.\n\n\n\nFor the Strength of Youth\n\nNow, while this upcoming decade may be filled with days *never to be forgotten* for every member of the Church, this especially can be true for you of the rising generation. You are here on earth now because you were selected to be here now. You have the strength and capacity to be disciples of Christ in an unprecedented way.\nPresident George&nbsp;Q. Cannon taught, \u201cGod has reserved spirits for this dispensation who have the courage and determination to face the world and all the powers of the evil one [and to] \u2026 build up the Zion of our God fearless of all consequences.\u201d\nTo that end, I wish to speak to you of the rising generation, to invite you to imagine how exciting this next decade, one never to be forgotten, can be *for you*. I also offer a few simple words of counsel and encouragement that may empower you during this coming decade.\nLike many of you, I have a smartphone that, on occasion and without any prompt, pulls together a reel of photos showing what I was doing on a certain day. It is always surprising to see how much things have changed for me and my family in just a few years.\nPicture the photos *your* phone will serve up 10 years from now! You may see yourself graduating from high school or college, receiving your endowment, going on a mission, getting married, and having your first child. For you personally, this will be a decade *never to be forgotten*. But it will be *doubly* so if you actively strive to become a light unto the world of how the glad tidings of the gospel of Jesus Christ can enrich and enhance not only your lives but also those of your family, friends, and social media followers.\nYou may be wondering how to do this.\nProphets of God have taught us this is done through four simple activities, referred to as divinely appointed responsibilities: first, living the gospel of Jesus Christ; second, caring for those in need; third, inviting all to receive the gospel; and fourth, uniting families for eternity. Remarkably, each can be done in the most normal and natural ways.\n\n\n\nDivinely Appointed Responsibilities\n\nI promise you this will be a decade never to be forgotten *for you* if you embrace these four divinely appointed responsibilities. Let\u2019s consider what this might entail.\n\n\nFirst, live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Study the words of the prophets, and learn to love your Father in Heaven. Incline your hearts to Him, and strive to walk in His way. Be lifted by the \u201ccovenant confidence\u201d that Elder Ulisses Soares has described. This confidence comes from making covenants to follow Jesus Christ, knowing that the Savior will in turn strengthen and support you.\nLet your friends see the joy you feel in living the gospel, and you will be the best gospel message they ever receive.\nSecond, reach out in compassion to care for those in need. Your generation is unusually mindful of the less fortunate. Whenever disaster strikes and Church members rush to help clear away debris and comfort the afflicted, it seems the majority wearing \u201cHelping Hands\u201d T-shirts are teenagers and twentysomethings. It is in your nature \u201cto bear one another\u2019s burdens\u201d and \u201ccomfort those that stand in need of comfort.\u201d By doing this we \u201cfulfil the law of Christ.\u201d\n\nEvan, a young Primary-age boy, decided to spend his summer vacation from school gathering supplies for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to donate to his local food bank. He found the project on the JustServe website. Young Evan enlisted his entire school class to help collect over 700 jars of jelly! Let the people you serve know that your concern for them is rooted in your love of God and your desire to treat your neighbor as yourself.\n\nThird, invite all to receive the gospel. This year we opened 36 new missions worldwide to accommodate all who desire to serve full-time missions. In an era when many youth are opting out of formal religious activity altogether, this is remarkable and speaks to the magnificent nature of your testimonies. Whether serving full-time or not, please realize your immense capacity to influence your peers as you love, share, and invite them to explore the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nFourth, unite families for eternity. As I visit temples around the world, I marvel at the standing-room-only crowds of youth waiting at the baptistry and the increased numbers of young adults serving as ordinance workers. Recently a group of over 600 youth from Scotland and Ireland traveled to the Preston England Temple, performing over 4,000 ordinances, many of which were for their personal deceased ancestors! I urge you to become engaged in family history, spend time in the temple, and carefully prepare yourself to be the kind of man or woman ready to marry an equally worthy companion in the temple. Develop a pattern in your life *now* to make the temple a regular part of your lives.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, my dear young friends, there will likely be difficulties for each of us in the days ahead. However, as we enter this coming decade of unprecedented moments, may we share glad tidings through the simple activities of living, caring, inviting, and uniting. As we do so, the Lord will bless us with experiences never to be forgotten.\nI testify that those who approach the Lord with a sincere heart and real intent, those who have the name of the Savior upon their lips and the Holy Spirit in their souls, those who embark upon this grand and glorious pilgrimage will discover and experience bounteous celestial blessings and receive a witness that God hears you, knows you, and loves you. You will experience days never to be forgotten. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Develop a pattern in your life *now* to make the temple a regular part of your lives."

        "full_markdown": "Elder Stevenson, this is a conference never to be forgotten.\nOur family has always enjoyed a little book called Children\u2019s Letters to God. Here are a few:\n\u201cDear God, instead of letting people die and having to make new ones, why don\u2019t you just keep the ones you\u2019ve got right now?\u201d\n\u201cHow come you only have ten rules, but our school has millions?\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you put the tonsils in if you\u2019re just going to take them out again?\u201d\nToday there isn\u2019t time to answer all *these* questions, but there is another question I often hear from young people that I would like to address. From Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, to Thomas, Idaho, the question is the same: \u201cWhy? Why must Latter-day Saints live so differently from others?\u201d\nI know it\u2019s hard to be different\u2014especially when you are young and want so badly for other people to like you. Everyone wants to fit in, and that desire is magnified to unhealthy proportions in today\u2019s digital world filled with social media and cyberbullying.\nSo, with all that pressure, why *do* Latter-day Saints live so differently? There are many good answers: Because you are a child of God. Because you have been saved for the last days. Because you are a disciple of Jesus Christ.\nBut those answers don\u2019t always set you apart. Everyone is a child of God. Everyone on earth right now was sent here in the latter days. And yet not everyone lives the Word of Wisdom or law of chastity the way you strive to. There are many valiant disciples of Christ who are not members of this Church. But they do not serve missions and perform ordinances in houses of the Lord on behalf of ancestors like you do. There must be more to it\u2014and there is.\nToday I would like to focus on an additional reason that has been meaningful in my life. In 1988 a young Apostle named Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson gave an address at Brigham Young University called \u201cThanks for the Covenant.\u201d In it, then-Elder Nelson explained that when we use our moral agency to make and keep covenants with God, we become heirs of the everlasting covenant God has made with our forebearers in every dispensation. Said another way, we become \u201cchildren of the covenant.\u201d That sets us apart. That gives us access to the same blessings our forefathers and foremothers received, including a birthright.\n*Birthright!* You may have heard that word. We even sing hymns about it: \u201cO youth of the noble birthright, carry on, carry on, carry on!\u201d It\u2019s a compelling word. But what does it mean?\nIn Old Testament times if a father passed away, his birthright son was responsible for the care of his mother and sisters. His brothers received their inheritance and left to make their way in the world, but the birthright son did not go anywhere. He would marry and have his own family, but he would stay until the end of his days to govern the affairs of his father\u2019s estate. Because of this added responsibility, he was given an added measure of the inheritance. Was leading and caring for others too much to ask? Not when you consider the additional inheritance he was given.\nToday we are not talking about your birth order in earthly families or Old Testament gender roles. We are talking about the inheritance you receive as a joint heir with Christ because of the covenant relationship you have chosen to enter with Him and your Father in Heaven. Is it too much for God to expect you to live differently than His other children so you can better lead and serve them? Not when you consider the blessings\u2014both temporal and spiritual\u2014that you have been given.\nDoes your birthright mean you are better than others? No, but it does mean you are expected to help others be better. Does your birthright mean you are chosen? Yes, but not chosen to rule over others; you are chosen to serve them. Is your birthright evidence of God\u2019s love? Yes, but more important, it is evidence of His trust.\nIt is one thing to be loved and another thing entirely to be trusted. In the For the Strength of Youth guide, we read: \u201cYour Father in Heaven trusts you. He has given you great blessings, including the fulness of the gospel and sacred ordinances and covenants that bind you to Him and bring His power into your life. With those blessings comes added responsibility. He knows you can make a difference in the world, and that requires, in many cases, being different from the world.\u201d\nOur mortal experience could be compared to a cruise ship on which God has sent all His children as they journey from one shore to another. The voyage is filled with opportunities to learn, grow, be happy, and progress, but it is also full of dangers. God loves all His children and is concerned about their welfare. He does not want to lose any of them, so He invites those who are willing to become members of His crew\u2014that\u2019s you. Because of your choice to make and keep covenants, He offers you His trust. He trusts you to be different, peculiar, and set apart because of the important work He trusts you to do.\nThink of it! God trusts you\u2014of all the people on the earth, the children of the covenant, His crew members\u2014to help with His work of bringing all His children safely home to Him. No wonder President Brigham Young once said, \u201cAll the angels in heaven are looking at this little handful of people.\u201d\nWhen you look around on this cruise ship called earth, you might see other people sitting in lounge chairs drinking, gambling in casinos, wearing clothing that is too revealing, scrolling endlessly on cell phones, and wasting too much time playing electronic games. But instead of wondering, \u201cWhy can\u2019t *I* do that?,\u201d you can remember that you are not an ordinary passenger. You are a member of the crew. You have responsibilities that passengers do not have. As Sister Ardeth Kapp once said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be a life[guard] if you look like all the other swimmers on the beach.\u201d\nAnd before you become discouraged by all the extra obligations, please remember that crew members receive something the other passengers do not: compensation. Elder Neil&nbsp;L. Andersen has said, \u201cThere is a compensatory spiritual power for the righteous,\u201d including \u201cgreater assurance, greater confirmation, and greater confidence.\u201d Like Abraham of old, you receive greater happiness and peace, greater righteousness, and greater knowledge. Your compensation is not merely a mansion in heaven and streets paved with gold. It would be easy for Heavenly Father to simply give you all that He has. His desire is to help you become all that He is. Thus, your commitments demand more of you because that is how God is making more of you.\nIt\u2019s \u201ca lot to ask of anyone, but you\u2019re not just anyone\u201d! You are youth of the noble birthright. Your covenant relationship with God and Jesus Christ is a relationship of love and trust in which you have access to a greater measure of Their grace\u2014Their divine assistance, endowment of strength, and enabling power. That power is not just wishful thinking, a lucky charm, or self-fulfilling prophecy. It is *real*.\nAs you fulfill your birthright responsibilities, you are never alone. The Lord of the vineyard labors with you. You are working hand in hand with Jesus Christ. With each new covenant\u2014and as your relationship with Him deepens\u2014you hold each other tighter and tighter until you are firmly clasped together. In that sacred symbol of His grace, you will find both the desire and the strength to live exactly how the Savior lived\u2014differently from the world. You\u2019ve got this because Jesus Christ has got you!\nIn [[2 Nephi 2|2&nbsp;Nephi 2:6]] we read, \u201cWherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.\u201d Because He is full of truth, He sees you as you really are\u2014flaws, weaknesses, regrets, and all. Because He is full of grace, He sees you as you really can be. He meets you where you are and helps you repent and improve, overcome and become.\n\u201cO youth of the noble birthright, carry on, carry on, carry on!\u201d I testify that you are loved\u2014and you are trusted\u2014today, in 20 years, and forever. Don\u2019t sell your birthright for a mess of pottage. Don\u2019t trade everything for nothing. Don\u2019t let the world change you when you were born to change the world. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

For many of us, there have been sleepless nights. We have tried to surround the people who are at risk with every force for good. We have pled in prayer for them. We have loved them. We have set the best example we could.\nAlma, a wise prophet from ancient times, faced similar trials. The people he led and loved were frequently under attack by a ferocious enemy, yet they were still trying to rear righteous children in a world of wickedness. Alma felt his only hope of victory was a force which at times we underestimate and often use too little. He pled for God\u2019s help.\nAlma knew that for God to help, repentance was required by those he led, as well as his adversaries. Thus, he opted for a different approach to battle.\nThe Book of Mormon describes it this way: \u201cAnd now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just\u2014yea, it had \u2026 more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them\u2014therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.\u201d\nThe word of God is the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ and by His prophets. Alma knew that the words of doctrine had great power.\nIn the [[D&C 18|18th section of the Doctrine and Covenants]], the Lord revealed the foundation of His doctrine:\n\u201cFor, behold, I command all men everywhere to repent.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cFor, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.\n\u201cAnd he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you shall fall down and worship the Father in my name.\n\u201c\u2026&nbsp;You must repent and be baptized, in the name of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\u201cAsk the Father in my name in faith, believing that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy Ghost.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now, after \u2026 you have received this, you must keep my commandments in all things.\u201d\n\u201cTake upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness.\n\u201cAnd as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and endure to the end, the same shall be saved.\u201d\nIn those few passages, the Savior gives us the perfect example of how we should teach His doctrine. This doctrine is that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end blesses all of God\u2019s children.\nAs we teach these principles to those we love, the Holy Ghost will help us to know the truth. Because we need the promptings of the Holy Ghost, we must avoid speculation or personal interpretation that goes beyond teaching true doctrine.\nThat can be hard to do when you love the person you are trying to influence. He or she may have ignored the doctrine that has been taught. It is tempting to try something new or sensational. But the Holy Ghost will reveal the spirit of truth only as we are cautious and careful not to go beyond teaching true doctrine. One of the surest ways to avoid even getting near false doctrine is to choose to be simple in our teaching. Safety is gained by that simplicity, and little is lost.\nTeaching simply allows us to share the saving doctrine early on, while children remain untouched by the deceiver\u2019s temptations that will later confront them, long before the truths they need to learn are drowned out by the noise of social media, peers, and their own personal struggles. We should seize every opportunity to share the teachings of Jesus Christ with children. These teaching moments are precious and far fewer compared to the relentless efforts of opposing forces. For every hour spent instilling doctrine into a child\u2019s life, there are countless hours of opposition filled with messages and images that challenge or ignore those saving truths.\nSome of you may wonder whether it might be better to draw your children closer to you through having fun, or you may ask whether the child may start to feel overwhelmed by your teachings. Instead, we should consider, \u201cWith so little time and so few opportunities, what words of doctrine can I share that will strengthen them against the inevitable challenges to their faith?\u201d The words you share today could be the ones they carry with them, and today will soon pass.\nI have always admired my great-grandmother Mary Bommeli\u2019s devotion to sharing the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Her family was taught by missionaries in Switzerland when she was 24.\nAfter being baptized, Mary desired to join the Saints in America, so she made her way from Switzerland to Berlin and found work with a woman who employed her to weave cloth for the family\u2019s clothing. Mary lived in a servant\u2019s room and set up her loom in the home\u2019s living area.\nAt that time, teaching the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was illegal in Berlin. But Mary found she could not keep from sharing the things she had learned. The woman of the house and her friends would gather around the loom to hear Mary teach. She spoke of the appearance of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to Joseph Smith, the visitation of angels, and the Book of Mormon. Remembering the accounts of Alma, she taught about the doctrine of the Resurrection. She testified that families can be reunited in the celestial kingdom.\nMary\u2019s enthusiasm to share the doctrine of the restored gospel soon caused trouble. It was not long before the police took Mary off to jail. On the way, she asked the policeman for the name of the judge she was to appear before the next morning. She also asked about his family and if he was a good father and husband. The policeman described the judge as a man of the world.\nIn the jail, Mary requested a pencil and some paper. She spent the night writing a letter to the judge, bearing witness to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the Book of Mormon, discussing the spirit world, and explaining repentance. She suggested that the judge would need time to reflect on his life before facing final judgment. She wrote that she knew he had much to repent of, much which would deeply sadden his family and bring him great sorrow. In the morning, when she had finished her letter, she gave it to the policeman and asked him to deliver it to the judge, and he agreed to do so.\nLater, the policeman was summoned by the judge to his office. The letter Mary had written was irrefutable evidence that she was teaching the doctrine of the restored gospel and, by so doing, breaking the law. However, it wasn\u2019t long before the policeman returned to Mary\u2019s cell. He told her that all charges were dismissed and that she was free to go. Her teaching the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ had caused her to be cast into jail. And her declaring the doctrine of repentance to the judge got her cast out of jail.\nMary Bommeli\u2019s teaching did not end with her release. The record of her words passed true doctrine down through generations yet unborn. Her belief that even a new convert could teach the doctrine of Jesus Christ has ensured that her descendants will be strengthened in their own battles.\nAs we do our best to teach those we love about the doctrine of Jesus Christ, some may still not respond. Doubts may creep into your mind. You might question whether you know the Savior\u2019s doctrine well enough to teach it effectively. And if you\u2019ve already made attempts to teach it, you may wonder why the positive effects aren\u2019t more visible. Don\u2019t give in to those doubts. Turn to God for help.\n\u201cYea, and cry unto God for all thy support; \u2026 let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.\u201d\nIf you pray, if you talk to God, and if you plead for His help for your loved one, and if you thank Him not only for help but for the patience and gentleness that come from not receiving all you desire right away or perhaps ever, then I promise you that you will draw closer to Him. You will become diligent and long-suffering. And then you can know that you have done all that you can to help those you love and those you pray for navigate through Satan\u2019s attempt to derail them.\n\u201cBut they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.\u201d\nYou can find hope in the scriptural record of families. We read of those who turned away from what they were taught or who were wrestling with God for forgiveness, such as Alma the Younger, the sons of Mosiah, and Enos. In their moments of crisis, they remembered the words of their parents, words of the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Remembering saved them. Your teaching of that sacred doctrine will be remembered.\nI bear witness of the sacred work of teaching Heavenly Father\u2019s children the simple doctrine of Jesus Christ, which allows us to be spiritually cleansed and ultimately be welcomed into God\u2019s presence, to live with Him and His Son in glory forever in families. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

It marks 75 years since I was baptized and confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Zwickau, Germany.\nMy membership in the Church of Jesus Christ is precious to me. To be counted among God\u2019s covenant people, with you, my brothers and sisters, is one of the greatest honors of my life.\nWhen I think about my personal journey of discipleship, my mind often goes back to an old villa in Zwickau, where I have cherished memories of attending sacrament meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ as a child. It is there where the seedling of my testimony received its earliest nourishing.\nThis chapel had an old air-driven organ. Every Sunday a young man was assigned to push up and down the sturdy lever operating the bellows to make the organ work. I sometimes had the great privilege of assisting in this important task.\nWhile the congregation sang our beloved hymns, I pumped with all my strength so the organ would not run out of wind. From the bellows operator seat, I had a great view of some stunning stained-glass windows, one depicting the Savior Jesus Christ and another portraying Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove.\nI can still remember the sacred feelings I had as I looked at those sunlit windows while listening to the testimonies of the Saints and singing the hymns of Zion.\nIn that holy place, the Spirit of God bore witness to my mind and heart that it was true: Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world. This is His Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ and heard Their voices.\nEarlier this year, while on assignment in Europe, I had the opportunity to return to Zwickau. Sadly, that beloved old chapel isn\u2019t there anymore. It was torn down many years ago to make room for a large apartment building.\n\n\n\nWhat Is Eternal, and What Is Not?\n\nI admit that it\u2019s sad to know that this beloved building from my childhood is now just a memory. It was a sacred building to me. But it was just a building.\nBy contrast, the spiritual witness I gained from the Holy Ghost those many years ago has not passed away. In fact, it has grown stronger. The things I learned in my youth about the fundamental principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ have been my firm foundation throughout my life. The covenant connection I forged with my Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son has stayed with me\u2014long after the Zwickau chapel was dismantled and the stained-glass windows were lost.\n\u201cHeaven and earth shall pass away,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cbut my words shall not pass away.\u201d\n\u201cThe mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord.\u201d\nOne of the most important things we can learn in this life is the difference between what is eternal and what is not. Once we understand that, everything changes\u2014our relationships, the choices we make, the way we treat people.\nKnowing what is eternal and what is not is key to growing a testimony of Jesus Christ and His Church.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t Mistake the Branches for the Roots\n\nThe restored gospel of Jesus Christ, as the Prophet Joseph Smith taught, \u201cembrace[s] all, and every item of truth.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean that all truth is of equal value. Some truths are core, essential, at the root of our faith. Others are appendages or branches\u2014valuable, but only when they are connected to the fundamentals.\nThe Prophet Joseph also said, \u201cThe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.\u201d\nIn other words, Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice are the root of our testimony. All other things are branches.\nThis is not to say that the branches are unimportant. A tree needs branches. But as the Savior told His disciples, \u201cThe branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine.\u201d Without a connection to the Savior, to the nourishment found in the roots, a branch withers and dies.\nWhen it comes to nourishing our testimonies of Jesus Christ, I wonder if we sometimes mistake the branches for the roots. This was the mistake Jesus observed in the Pharisees of His day. They paid so much attention to the relatively minor details of the law that they ended up neglecting what the Savior called \u201cthe weightier matters\u201d\u2014fundamental principles like \u201cjustice and mercy and faith.\u201d\nIf you want to nourish a tree, you don\u2019t splash water on the branches. You water the roots. Similarly, if you want the branches of your testimony to grow and bear fruit, nourish the roots. If you are uncertain about a particular doctrine or practice or element of Church history, seek clarity with faith in Jesus Christ. Seek to understand His sacrifice for you, His love for you, His will for you. Follow Him in humility. The branches of your testimony will draw strength from your deepening faith in Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son.\nFor example, if you want a stronger testimony of the Book of Mormon, focus on its witness of Jesus Christ. Notice how the Book of Mormon testifies of Him, what it teaches about Him, and how it invites and inspires you to come unto Him.\nIf you\u2019re seeking a more meaningful experience in Church meetings or in the temple, try looking for the Savior in the sacred ordinances we receive there. Find the Lord in His holy house.\nIf you ever feel burned out or overwhelmed by your Church calling, try refocusing your service on Jesus Christ. Make it an expression of your love for Him.\nNourish the roots, and the branches will grow. And in time, they will bear fruit.\n\n\n\nRooted and Built Up in Him\n\nStrong faith in Jesus Christ doesn\u2019t happen overnight. No, in this mortal world, it\u2019s the thorns and thistles of doubt that grow spontaneously. The healthy, fruitful tree of faith requires intentional effort. And a vital part of that effort is making sure we are firmly rooted in Christ.\nFor example: At first, we may be drawn to the Savior\u2019s gospel and Church because we are impressed by the friendly members or by the kind bishop or the clean looks of the chapel. These circumstances are certainly important to grow the Church.\nNevertheless, if the roots of our testimony never grow deeper than that, what will happen when we move to a ward that meets in a less impressive building, with members who aren\u2019t so friendly, and the bishop says something that offends us?\nAnother example: Doesn\u2019t it seem reasonable to hope that if we keep the commandments and are sealed in the temple, we will be blessed with a large, happy family with bright, obedient children, all of whom stay active in the Church, serve missions, sing in the ward choir, and volunteer to help clean the meetinghouse every Saturday morning?\nI certainly hope that all of us will see this in our lives. But what if it doesn\u2019t happen? Will we stay bound to the Savior regardless of circumstances\u2014trusting Him and His timing?\nWe must ask ourselves: Is my testimony based on what I hope to happen in my life? Is it dependent on the actions or attitudes of others? Or is it firmly founded on Jesus Christ, \u201crooted and built up in him,\u201d regardless of life\u2019s changing circumstances?\n\n\n\nTraditions, Habits, and Faith\n\nThe Book of Mormon tells of a people who \u201cwere strict in observing the ordinances of God.\u201d But then a skeptic named Korihor came along, mocking the Savior\u2019s gospel, calling it the \u201cfoolish\u201d and \u201csilly traditions of their fathers.\u201d Korihor led \u201caway the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness.\u201d But others he could not deceive, because to them, the gospel of Jesus Christ was much more than a tradition.\nFaith is strong when it has deep roots in personal experience, personal commitment to Jesus Christ, independent of what our traditions are or what others may say or do.\nOur testimony will be tested and tried. Faith is not faith if never tested. Faith is not strong if never opposed. So don\u2019t despair if you have trials of faith or unanswered questions.\nWe should not expect to understand everything before we act. That is not faith. As Alma taught, \u201cFaith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things.\u201d If we wait to act until all of our questions are answered, we severely limit the good we can accomplish, and we limit the power of our faith.\nFaith is beautiful because it persists even when blessings don\u2019t come as hoped for. We can\u2019t see the future, we don\u2019t know all the answers, but we can trust Jesus Christ as we keep moving forward and upward because He is our Savior and Redeemer.\nFaith endures the trials and the uncertainties of life because it is firmly rooted in Christ and His doctrine. Jesus Christ, and our Father in Heaven who sent Him, together constitute the one undeviating, perfectly reliable object of our trust.\nA testimony is not something that you build once and it stands forever. It\u2019s more like a tree that you nourish constantly. Planting the word of God in your heart is only the first step. Once your testimony starts to grow, then the real work begins! That\u2019s when you \u201cnourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit.\u201d It takes \u201cgreat diligence\u201d and \u201cpatience with the word.\u201d But the Lord\u2019s promises are sure: \u201cYe shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.\u201d\nMy dear brothers and sisters, my dear friends, there\u2019s a part of me that misses the old Zwickau chapel and its stained-glass windows. But over the past 75 years, Jesus Christ has led me on a journey through life that is more thrilling than I could ever have imagined. He has comforted me in my afflictions, helped me to recognize my weaknesses, healed my spiritual wounds, and nourished me in my growing faith.\nIt is my sincere prayer and blessing that we will constantly nourish the roots of our faith in the Savior, in His doctrine, and in His Church. Of this I testify in the sacred name of our Savior, our Redeemer, our Master\u2014in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

It\u2019s good for families to establish righteous traditions. But it\u2019s just as important for families to clearly understand the *why* behind those traditions. Why do we pray every morning and night? Why do we have family scripture study? Why do we hold weekly home evening, family activities and service projects, and so on? If our children understand how these traditions draw us closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, they\u2019ll be more likely to continue them\u2014and improve on them\u2014in their own families."

        "full_markdown": "God is our Father in Heaven. We are His spirit children, and we are created after His image. Therefore, each of us, as a child of God, has a divine potential to become like Him.\nWe lived with Him as spirits before we came to this earth. Heavenly Father, as our spirit parent, loves us, wants the best for us, and prepared a plan for us to receive His greatest blessings, which are immortality and eternal life. According to the plan, we, as spirit children, would be given agency to choose His plan. By coming to the earth, we would leave God\u2019s presence, forget our premortal life, receive bodies of flesh and bones, gain our own experience, and develop faith. With our bodies of flesh and bones, as natural men we would succumb to temptation, become unclean and distant from God, and not be able to return to His holy presence. Because of Heavenly Father\u2019s infinite love for us, He sent His Firstborn Son, Jesus Christ, to be our Savior. Through His sacrifice, the Atonement, Jesus Christ made it possible for us to be redeemed from our sins and be resurrected and receive eternal life.\nI am extremely grateful for these glorious truths\u2014what we call the Father\u2019s plan of salvation, His plan of mercy, or His great plan of happiness. Learning these important truths has helped me know my true identity and the great blessings of exaltation and eternal life God has prepared for us. The prophet Nephi taught us the way: \u201cWherefore,&nbsp;\u2026 feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.\u201d He added, \u201cIf ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.\u201d Today I would like to share how the words of Christ and the Holy Ghost helped me find these important peace-giving truths in my teenage years.\n\n\nThe Words of Christ Will Tell You All Things What You Should Do\n\nJust like Nephi stated in the opening verse of the book of 1&nbsp;Nephi, I was also \u201cborn of goodly parents.\u201d I grew up in Nagano, Japan, in a home where honesty, diligence, and humility were strongly encouraged and conformity to the old customs was strictly followed. My father was a very religious man. I watched him praying in front of the Shinto and Buddhist altars every morning and every night. Even though I had no idea whom he was praying to and what he was praying for, I believed some sort of unseen power or God would be \u201cmighty to save\u201d or help us if we prayed sincerely.\nLike other teenagers, I experienced many hardships. I struggled, thinking that life was unfair and had lots of ups and downs. I felt lost, not having a sense of direction in my life. Life seemed so fleeting because it would end when I died. Life without knowing the plan of salvation was confusing.\nNot long after I started to learn English in junior high school, all the students in our school received a copy of the New Testament. Though we had barely begun our study of English, our teacher told us we should study English by reading it. I opened it and reviewed its contents. The words in the New Testament were extremely difficult for me. The words in Japanese were equally difficult. However, I was drawn to a list of statements and questions of the soul that had been included just before the biblical text in this Gideon Bible\u2014questions about feeling lonely, lacking confidence, being confused, facing life\u2019s trials, and so on. Each item on the list was followed by a reference to verses and pages in the New Testament. I was especially drawn to the statement \u201cWhen you are weary.\u201d The reference led me to open [[Matthew 11|Matthew 11:28\u201330]], in which Jesus said to His disciples:\n\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d\nThis was the first time I remember reading the words of Jesus Christ. Though I did not understand all the words He said, His words comforted me, lifted my soul, and gave me hope. The more I read His words, the more I felt like I should try the virtue of His words. I had never felt like I felt that day. I felt I was loved. I felt that Jesus Christ was someone I knew.\nAs I continued studying, I felt as though He were speaking directly to me when He said, \u201cBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\u201d\nHis words filled my heart, even though I could not describe my feelings well at that time. Although Jesus Christ lived many centuries ago in a land unfamiliar to me, I thought I could trust His words with all my heart. I hoped someday in the future I might learn more about Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nThe Holy Ghost Will Show You All Things What You Should Do\n\nThat someday came only a few years later. I met very dedicated, young, full-time missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And I soon met a small group of kind and joyful Latter-day Saints striving to follow Jesus Christ. Despite it taking me a while to fully trust them, I came to see in the restored gospel what I yearned for when I studied the New Testament\u2014the words of Jesus Christ and the hope and peace that come from them.\nA particularly sacred experience was when the missionaries taught me to pray. I learned that we should address God by name. When we pray, we should speak from our hearts, express our gratitude, and share our hopes and desires. Once we have said all that we want to say, we end our prayer by saying, \u201cIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\u201d We do this because Jesus commanded us to pray in His name. Praying to Heavenly Father helped me know who He is and my relationship with Him\u2014that I was His beloved spirit son. I learned that because Heavenly Father knows and loves me, He would speak to me personally, uniquely, and in ways I would understand through the Holy Ghost.\nThere was a time when I really could not recognize the Holy Ghost. I misunderstood, thinking that all I had to do was follow the steps of prayer and something dramatic would happen. One day, during a lesson with the missionaries, I stepped out of the lesson to take a break. I was still confused about what I should do with my life if the restored gospel of Jesus Christ really was true.\nAs I was about to return to the room where the missionaries were waiting, I heard the voice of one of the missionaries. I heard my name. Instead of opening the door, I listened to the voice on the other side of the door. I was stunned. They were simply praying to Heavenly Father. The one saying the prayer was pleading to God that He would hear my prayer. Though his Japanese was not fluent, hearing his sincere prayer softened my heart. I wondered why they cared about me so much. Then I realized that their prayer in my behalf was a reflection of Heavenly Father and the Savior\u2019s love for me. That love gave me hope, and afterward I did ask God in faith and with real intent. When I did, I felt a joyful and peaceful feeling that I was indeed a child of God and that I had a divine potential and destiny. The plan of salvation sank deep into my heart.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has said, \u201cThe way you think about who you&nbsp;\u2026 are affects&nbsp;\u2026 every decision you will ever make.\u201d It is so true for me. The decision to follow the Savior Jesus Christ by being baptized and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost blessed my life more than I ever imagined. As we enter into the baptismal covenant with God, we promise that we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, keep the commandments of God, and serve Him for the remainder of our lives. Our Heavenly Father, in turn, promises us that we can always have His Spirit to be with us\u2014the continued guidance from the Holy Ghost.\nI invite you to have faith in the message Nephi taught us\u2014that the words of Christ and the Holy Ghost will direct you to \u201call things what [you] should do.\u201d Everything! This is an incredible gift from God.\nBrothers and sisters, I am grateful for our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of salvation. Because He loves us, He prepared the way to return to His presence through His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ. Knowing this incredible plan will help us know we are children of God and we can become like Him. I am grateful for this important truth. I bear you my witness that the words of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost will lead us to receive eternal life. I know these things are true. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

Praying to Heavenly Father helped me know who He is and my relationship with Him\u2014that I was His beloved spirit son.

The one saying the prayer was pleading to God that He would hear my prayer. Though his Japanese was not fluent, hearing his sincere prayer softened my heart. I wondered why they cared about me so much. Then I realized that their prayer in my behalf was a reflection of Heavenly Father and the Savior\u2019s love for me. That love gave me hope, and afterward I did ask God in faith and with real intent. When I did, I felt a joyful and peaceful feeling that I was indeed a child of God and that I had a divine potential and destiny. The plan of salvation sank deep into my heart."

        "full_markdown": "To the many testimonies at this conference, I add my apostolic witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, our Lord and Savior, the Redeemer of all of our Father\u2019s children. By His Atonement, Jesus Christ made it possible for us, if we are worthy, to return to the presence of our Father in Heaven and be with our families for eternity.\nThe Savior is not absent from our mortal journeys. For the past two days we have heard Him speak through His chosen leaders that we might draw closer to Him. Time and again, with His pure love and mercy, He sustains us as we face the drama of life. Nephi describes: \u201cMy God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions.&nbsp;\u2026 He hath filled me with his love.\u201d\nThat love is evident when we sustain one another in His work.\nWe sustain our living prophet at general conference, and the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, General Authorities, and Officers of the Church. To sustain means to *hold up* another person, to give them our attention, to be faithful to their trust, to act upon their words. They speak by inspiration of the Lord; they understand the current issues, the moral decline of society, and the adversary\u2019s increasing efforts to thwart the Father\u2019s plan. In *holding up* our hands, we are committing our support, not just for that moment but in our daily lives.\nSustaining includes *holding up* our stake presidents and bishops, quorum and organization leaders, teachers, and even camp directors in our wards and stakes. Closer to home, we *hold up* our wives and our husbands, children, parents, extended family, and neighbors. When we *hold up* one another we are saying, \u201cI am here for you, not just to *hold up* your arms and hands when they \u2018hang down\u2019 but to be a comfort and strength at your side.\u201d\nThe concept to *hold up* is rooted in scripture. At the Waters of Mormon, the newly baptized Church members committed \u201cto bear one another\u2019s burdens, that they may be light; \u2026 [to] comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.\u201d\nTo the Nephites, Jesus said: \u201c*Hold up* your light that it may shine unto the world. *Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up*.\u201d We *hold up* the Lord\u2019s light when we hold fast to our covenants and when we support our living prophet as he speaks the words of God.\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson said, when serving in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, \u201cOur sustaining of prophets is a personal commitment that we will do our utmost to uphold their prophetic priorities.\u201d\nTo *hold up* the prophet is a sacred work. We do not sit quietly by but actively defend him, follow his counsel, teach his words, and pray for him.\nKing Benjamin, in the Book of Mormon, said to the people, \u201cI am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen \u2026 and was suffered by the hand of the Lord \u2026 and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.\u201d\n\nLikewise, at age 100, President Nelson has been kept and preserved by the Lord. President Harold&nbsp;B. Lee, at the time a member of the First Presidency, cited the example of Moses standing atop the hill at Rephidim. \u201cThe hands of [the President of the Church] may grow weary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may tend to droop at times because of his heavy responsibilities; but as we uphold his hands, and as we lead under his direction, by his side, the gates of hell will not prevail against you and against Israel. Your safety and ours depends upon whether or not we follow the ones whom the Lord has placed to preside over his church. He knows whom he wants to preside over this church, and he will make no mistake.\u201d\nPresident Nelson draws upon years of serving the Lord. His maturity, wide-ranging experience, wisdom, and consistent receipt of revelation is specifically suited for our day. He has said: \u201cThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is preparing the world for the day when \u2018the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord\u2019 ([[Isaiah 11|Isaiah 11:9]]). \u2026 This work is empowered by a divine announcement made 200 years ago. It consisted of only seven words: \u2018This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u2019 (see [[Joseph Smith\u2014History 1|Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:17]]).\u201d\nPresident Nelson has also said: \u201cThere has never been a time in the history of the world when knowledge of our Savior is more personally vital and relevant to *every human soul*. Imagine how quickly the devastating conflicts throughout the world\u2014and those in our individual lives\u2014would be resolved if we all chose to follow Jesus Christ and heed His teachings.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, we need to do more lifting and less murmuring, more upholding the word of the Lord, His ways, and His prophet, who has said: \u201cOne of our greatest challenges today is distinguishing between the truths of God and the counterfeits of Satan. That is why the Lord warned us to \u2018pray always, \u2026 that [we] may conquer Satan, and \u2026 *escape the hands of the servants of Satan* that do uphold [the adversary\u2019s] work\u2019 [[[D&C 10|Doctrine and Covenants 10:5]]; emphasis added].\u201d\n\nLast April, Sister Rasband and I had the honor of joining our beloved prophet and Sister Nelson for the rededication of the Manti Utah Temple.\nPresident Nelson surprised everyone when he entered the room. Only a very few of us knew he was coming. In his presence, I immediately felt the light and prophetic mantle he carries. The look of joy on the faces of the people personally seeing the prophet will stay with me forever.\nIn the prayer of rededication, President Nelson petitioned the Lord that His holy house would essentially *hold up* all who entered the temple, \u201cthat they may receive sacred blessings and remain worthy and faithful to their covenants \u2026 that this may be a house of peace, a house of comfort, and a house of personal revelation for all who enter these doors worthily.\u201d\nWe all need to be lifted up by the Lord with peace, with comfort, and most of all with personal revelation to counter the fear, darkness, and contention encompassing the world.\nBefore the service, we stood outside in the sun with President and Sister Nelson to view the beautiful setting. President Nelson\u2019s ancestral ties to the area run deep. His eight great-grandparents settled in the valleys surrounding the temple, as did some of mine. My great-grandfather Andrew Anderson served on the construction crew of early pioneers who labored 11 years to complete the Manti Temple, the third in the Rocky Mountains.\nAs we stood with President Nelson, we had the opportunity to *hold up* and support the prophet of God in celebration of the rededication of the Lord\u2019s holy house. It was a day I will never forget.\n\u201cWe build temples to honor the Lord,\u201d President Nelson said that sacred day. \u201cThey are built for worship and not for show. We make sacred covenants of eternal significance inside these sacred walls.\u201d We are gathering Israel.\nPresident Nelson and the prophets before him have cradled the holy temples in their arms. Today, around the world, we have 350 sacred houses of the Lord that are operating, announced, or under construction. As prophet, since 2018, President Nelson has announced 168 temples.\n\u201cIn our time,\u201d he has said, \u201ca whole, complete, and perfect union of all dispensations, keys, and powers are to be welded together (see [[D&C 128|Doctrine and Covenants 128:18]]). For these sacred purposes, holy temples now dot the earth. I emphasize again that construction of these temples may not change your life, but your service in the temple surely will.\u201d\n\u201cThe Savior and His doctrine are the very heart of the temple,\u201d the President says. \u201cEverything taught in the temple, through instruction and through the Spirit, increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. His essential ordinances bind us to Him through sacred priesthood covenants. Then, as we keep our covenants, He endows us with *His* healing, strengthening power.\u201d\n\u201cAll who worship in the temple,\u201d President Nelson has said, \u201cwill have the power of God and angels having \u2018charge over them\u2019 [[[D&C 109|Doctrine and Covenants 109:22]]]. How much does it increase your confidence to know that, as an endowed woman or man [or temple-attending youth] armed with the power of God, you do not have to face life alone? What courage does it give you to know that angels really will help you?\u201d\nAngels reaching out to *hold us up* is described in the scriptures when Jesus Christ knelt humbly in the Garden of Gethsemane. By His suffering He provided an infinite Atonement. \u201cThere,\u201d President Nelson states, \u201cthe greatest single act of love of all recorded history took place. \u2026 There at Gethsemane, the Lord \u2018suffered the pain of all men, that all \u2026 might repent and come unto him\u2019 [[[D&C 18|Doctrine and Covenants 18:11]]].\u201d\n\u201cRemove this cup from me,\u201d Jesus Christ asked, \u201cnevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.\n\u201cAnd there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.\u201d\nWe have angels round about us today.

Great spiritual manifestations accompanied the services, and priesthood keys were restored by Moses, Elias, and Elijah so that temple work and the gathering of Israel could begin in earnest.\nJoseph Smith recorded, \u201cIt was a Pentecost and an endowment indeed, long to be remembered, for the sound shall go forth from this place into all the world, and the occurrences of this day shall be handed down upon the pages of sacred history to all generations, as the day of Pentecost, so shall this day be numbered and celebrated as a year of Jubilee and time of rejoicing to the Saints of the Most High God\u201d ([Joseph Smith, Journal, 1835\u20131836](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-1835-1836/192), 189\u201390, josephsmithpapers.org; spelling, capitalization, and punctuation modernized). The Nauvoo Temple was dedicated officially in May 1846, after the majority of the Saints had abandoned their homes and community. More than 6,000 Saints made temple covenants before fleeing to the West.

        "full_markdown": "My wife, Mary, and I recently saw a T-shirt with the picture of a book and a message on the front which read, \u201cBooks: The Original Handheld Device.\u201d\n\nI thought about this interesting message and how significant handheld devices of all kinds have become. Upon further contemplation, I realized that any device or even one equipped with artificial intelligence will never be as important or significant as the spiritual guidance that comes from divine revelation.\nWhether handheld or digital, the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ provide spiritual guidance and teaching from Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. We treasure these books for their profound role in documenting God\u2019s direction to ancient prophets and people and the guidance they provide for our own personal lives.\nCombined with the teachings of living prophets, these sacred scriptures provide doctrinal direction for us in today\u2019s world. These scriptures are most powerful when they give instruction, correction, comfort, and consolation to individuals and families who seek guidance from the Lord.\nThe scriptures, combined with spiritual inspiration from the Holy Spirit, continue to be the primary source that facilitates the conversion of those who have broken hearts and contrite spirits and desire to follow Jesus Christ. The scriptures help build a foundation that can withstand the adversary\u2019s constant efforts to undermine faith.\nNew converts have blessed and been the lifeblood of the Church throughout its history. One example is particularly precious to me. When I was a young bishop, two marvelous sister missionaries were teaching the William Edward Mussman family. The father, a very capable lawyer, was general counsel of a major corporation. His devoted wife, Janet, was helping the family strive to live a more Christlike life.\nTheir exceptional son and daughter, both in their early 20s, were also being taught. All four had received the lessons and were attending church. The sister missionaries had emphasized reading the Book of Mormon and praying for a testimony of that sacred scripture. Remarkably, the family prayerfully read the entire Book of Mormon in a short time.\nThe stake missionaries, both of whom were prior ward Relief Society presidents, accompanied them to sacrament meetings.\nAs the family was nearing baptism, they received a barrage of literature critical of the Church. This was before the internet, but the material filled a large cardboard box.\nThe sister missionaries invited me as a recently called 34-year-old bishop to help answer the questions being raised. When we gathered in their living room, the large box of pamphlets critical of the Church was in the middle of the room. I had prayerfully approached this assignment. During the opening prayer, the Spirit whispered to me, \u201cHe already knows it is true.\u201d This was important. The sisters believed that the rest of the family already had a testimony. They were unsure about the father.\nI immediately informed him that the Spirit had prompted me that he already had a testimony. \u201cWas that true?\u201d He looked at me intently and said that the Spirit had confirmed the truth of the Book of Mormon and the Church to him.\nI then asked whether it would be necessary to review the pamphlets, if they already had a spiritual confirmation.\nThe father replied that it would not be necessary. The rest of the family concurred with his answer.\nHe said he did have a significant question: One reason they had received so much literature opposing the Church was that they were members of another faith. In addition, he had made a large pledge to help build a new chapel for that faith. He informed me that the sister missionaries had taught him about the importance of tithing, which he gratefully accepted, but he wondered if it would be wrong to also honor the pledge he had previously made. I assured him that payment of the pledge would be both honorable and appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe Mussmans with their son, daughter-in-law, and daughter.\n\n\nThe entire family was baptized. One year later they were sealed as a family in the Oakland California Temple. I was privileged to be present. The son completed law school, passed the California Bar Exam, and immediately served a faithful mission in Japan. I have watched over the years as the succeeding generations have remained faithful to the gospel. I was privileged to officiate at the sealing of one of the granddaughters.\nThe conversions that are occurring in our day are equally remarkable. Last June, Coach Andy Reid, head football coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, and I, along with others representing our faith and other faiths, spoke in a multifaith event at the Riverside Church in New York City. Coach Reid emphasized second chances and responding to invitations and opportunities, which is what the gospel of Jesus Christ is all about. The next morning, with our wives, Tammy Reid and Mary, we attended the sacrament meeting at the Manhattan Second Ward. It was a spiritual service. There were many new converts in the congregation. Five recently baptized members, four men and one young man, were among the Aaronic Priesthood members passing the sacrament. I am happy to report that a similar influx of new members is happening throughout the Church.\nWe are grateful for the noticeable increase in those who respond to sacred invitations, change their lives, and accept the opportunity to follow Jesus Christ. They enter the covenant path through faith, repentance, baptism, and confirmation as taught in the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon.\nWe cannot underestimate the significance of sacred scriptures both in conversions and in remaining faithful in the gospel. The ancient prophets described in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of Jesus Christ and taught His gospel. The Book of Mormon helps us draw closer to God as we learn, understand, and apply its teachings. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, \u201cA man [or woman] would get nearer to God by abiding by [the book\u2019s] precepts, than by any other book.\u201d\nTo know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, we need to read, ponder, and pray about it and then act according to its precepts. The prophet Moroni promised that God will reveal the truth of the book to us as we pray with a sincere heart, with real intent, and with faith in Christ. Studying the Book of Mormon is essential for enduring conversion.\nAs we contemplate the relationship between the Bible and the Book of Mormon as handheld devices, one might ask a question. How useful and complementary do you think two books would be if the Lord declared they would be joined together and \u201cbecome one in thine hand\u201d? That is what the Lord declared concerning the \u201cstick of Judah,\u201d the Bible, and the \u201cstick of Joseph,\u201d the Book of Mormon.\nIn many significant respects, the Book of Mormon provides fundamental doctrine that enhances and builds upon the Bible. The doctrine of the Atonement of Jesus Christ is a profound example.\nThe Bible provides an accurate account of the mortal ministry of Jesus Christ, including His death and Resurrection. The Book of Mormon is more explicit about the Atonement of Jesus Christ, something prophets explained in detail prior to His death.\nThe heading to [[Alma 42|Alma chapter 42]] reflects the doctrinal significance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\nIt reads: \u201cMortality is a probationary time to enable man to repent and serve God\u2014The Fall brought temporal and spiritual death upon all mankind\u2014Redemption comes through repentance\u2014God Himself atones for the sins of the world\u2014Mercy is for those who repent\u2014All others are subject to God\u2019s justice\u2014Mercy comes because of the Atonement\u2014Only the truly penitent are saved.\u201d\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has said, \u201cI promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon *every day*, you will make better decisions\u2014*every day*.\u201d He also promises that if \u201cyou daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized against the evils of the day.\u201d\nAs I mentioned, I was impressed with the concept of the original handheld device\u2014a book. However, I recognize the incredible significance of the internet in the world today. One modern handheld device can provide the information that historically has filled a major library. We are grateful to live in such a time as this. I am particularly grateful that it allows sacred books and Church materials to be available digitally. The internet is a powerful tool for studying the gospel. Today, many people share scriptures with friends using technology. The [Book of Mormon app](https://go.churchofjesuschrist.org/bookofmormonapp), for example, is a wonderful way to introduce friends to the Book of Mormon and can easily be shared in normal and natural ways wherever you may be.\n\nWhile the internet provides many blessings, unfortunately, like the written pamphlets critical of the Church I described earlier, it has also been used to create doubt and undermine faith in precious gospel principles. It can be part of the \u201cevils of the day\u201d that President Nelson mentioned.\nThe adversary and those who assist him, knowingly or unwittingly, have created on the internet the equivalent of the box full of written material critical of the Church I described earlier, intended to draw you away from God\u2019s truth.\nThe issues raised to create doubt over the years have been remarkably similar. This is especially true when you compare our day with the 1960s, when I was in my 20s.\nThe scriptures teach us to use judgment and be wise in all things. The internet can be used in a positive way or a destructive way.\nBoth long-term members and those newly studying the gospel need to be intentional about what they view. Do not entertain immoral, dishonest, or unrighteous material. If you do, algorithms can lead you down a path that destroys faith and impairs your eternal progression. You can be acted upon positively or negatively. Seek righteousness and avoid dark internet rabbit holes and doomscrolling. Fill your life with positive, righteous ideas; be joyful; have fun but avoid foolishness. There is a difference. The [[Articles of Faith 1|thirteenth article of faith]] is a marvelous guide. Above all, immerse yourself regularly in the Book of Mormon, which will draw the Spirit into your life and help you discern truth from error.\nMy counsel for those who have in any way deviated from the covenant path is to return to the sacred scriptures, prophetic guidance, religious observance in the home, and the music of faith. Every soul is precious to the Lord. We need you! The Lord needs you, and you need Him! You will always be welcome. During my many years of Church service, I have cherished the wonderful people who returned to the covenant path and then served and blessed everyone they loved or with whom they came in contact.\nThe sacred scriptures and living prophets are a major way a loving Heavenly Father makes His plan of happiness available to all His children.\nI bear my sure witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and the reality of His Atonement, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "Today I would like to address one of the most joyful, glorious, and powerful gospel truths that God has revealed. At the same time, it is ironically one for which we have been criticized. An experience I had some years ago profoundly deepened my appreciation for this gospel truth.\nAs a representative of the Church, I was once invited to a religious conference where it was announced that from that moment on they would recognize as valid all baptisms performed by almost all other Christian churches, as long as the ordinance was done with water and in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Then it was explained that this policy did not apply to baptisms performed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nAfter the conference I was able to delve deeper into the reasons for that exception with the leader in charge of the announcement. We had a wonderful and insightful conversation.\nIn short, he explained to me that that exception had primarily to do with our particular beliefs about the Godhead, which other Christian denominations often refer to as the Trinity. I expressed my appreciation for him taking the time to explain to me his beliefs and the policy of his church. At the end of our conversation, we hugged and then said goodbye.\nAs I later contemplated our discussion, what this leader said about Latter-day Saints not understanding what he called the \u201cmystery of the Trinity\u201d stayed in my mind. What was he referring to? Well, it had to do with our understanding of the nature of God. We believe that God the Father \u201cis an exalted man\u201d with a glorified \u201cbody of flesh and bones as tangible as man\u2019s; [and] the Son also.\u201d Thus, every time we talk about the nature of God, in some way, somehow, we are also talking about our own nature.\nAnd this is true not only because we all were made \u201cin [His] image, after [His] likeness,\u201d but also because, as the Psalmist recorded, God said, \u201cYe are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.\u201d This is for us a precious doctrine now recovered with the advent of the Restoration. In summary, it is nothing more or less than what our missionaries teach as the first lesson, first paragraph, first line: \u201cGod is our Heavenly Father, and we are His children.\u201d\nNow, you might say, \u201cBut many people believe we are children of God.\u201d Yes, that is true, but their understanding may be a little different from the implication of its deeper meaning that we affirm. For Latter-day Saints, this teaching is not metaphorical. Rather, we truly believe that we are all literally the children of God. He is \u201cthe Father of [our] spirits,\u201d and because of that, we have the potential to become like Him, which seems to be inconceivable to some.\nIt has now been over 200 years since the First Vision opened the doors to the Restoration. At the time, young Joseph Smith sought guidance from heaven to know what church to join. Through the revelation he received that day, and in later revelations given to him, the Prophet Joseph obtained knowledge about the nature of God and our relationship to Him as His children.\nBecause of that, we learn more clearly that our Heavenly Father has taught this precious doctrine from the very beginning. Allow me to cite at least two accounts from the scriptures to illustrate this.\nYou might remember God\u2019s instructions to Moses as recorded in the Pearl of Great Price.\nWe read that \u201cGod spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name.\u201d In other words, Moses, *I want you to know who I am*. Then He added, \u201cAnd, behold, *thou art my son*.\u201d Later he said, \u201cAnd I have a work for thee, *Moses, my son*; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten.\u201d And then finally, He ended with, \u201cAnd now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, *Moses, my son*.\u201d\n\nIt appears that God was determined to teach Moses at least one lesson: \u201cYou are my child,\u201d which He repeated at least three times. He could not even mention the name of Moses without immediately adding that he was His son.\nHowever, after Moses was left alone, he felt weak because he was no longer in the presence of God. That is when Satan came to tempt him. Can you see a pattern here? The first thing he said was, \u201cMoses, *son of man*, worship me.\u201d\nIn this context, Satan\u2019s request to worship him may have been only a distraction. A significant temptation for Moses in that moment of weakness was to become confused and believe that he was only a \u201cson of man,\u201d rather than a child of God.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? For behold, *I am a son of God*, in the similitude of his Only Begotten.\u201d Fortunately, Moses was not confused and did not allow himself to become distracted. He had learned the lesson of who he really was.\nThe next account is found in [[Matthew 4|Matthew 4]]. Scholars have entitled this \u201cthe three temptations of Jesus,\u201d as if the Lord was tempted only three times, which of course is not the case.\nHundreds of gallons of ink have been used to explain the meaning and content of these temptations. As we know, the chapter begins by explaining that Jesus had gone into the desert, \u201cand when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.\u201d\nSatan\u2019s first temptation apparently had only to do with satisfying the Lord\u2019s physical needs. \u201cCommand that these stones be made bread,\u201d he challenged the Savior.\nA second enticement may have had to do with tempting God: \u201cCast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee.\u201d\nFinally, Satan\u2019s third temptation referred to the aspirations and glory of the world. After Jesus had been shown \u201call the kingdoms of the world, \u2026 [Satan] saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\u201d\nIn truth, Satan\u2019s ultimate temptation may have had less to do with those three specific provocations and more to do with tempting Jesus Christ *to question His divine nature*. At least twice, the enticement was preceded by the challenging accusation from Satan: \u201cIf thou be the Son of God\u201d\u2014if you really believe it, then do this or that.\nPlease notice what had happened immediately before Jesus went into the desert to fast and pray: we find the account of Christ\u2019s baptism. And when He had come out of the water, there came \u201ca voice from heaven, saying, *This is my beloved Son*, in whom I am well pleased.\u201d\nDo we see the connection? Can we recognize a pattern here?\nIt is no wonder that every time we are taught about our divine nature and destiny, the adversary of all righteousness tempts us to call them into question.\nHow different our decisions would be if we really knew who we really are.\nWe live in a challenging world, a world of increasing commotion, where honorable people strive to at least emphasize our human dignity, while we belong to a church and embrace a gospel that lift our vision and invite us into the divine.\nJesus\u2019s commandment to be \u201cperfect, even as [our] Father which is in heaven is perfect\u201d is a clear reflection of His high expectations and our eternal possibilities. Now, none of this will happen overnight. In the words of President Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland, it will happen \u201ceventually.\u201d But the promise is that if we \u201ccome unto Christ,\u201d we will \u201cbe perfected in him.\u201d That requires a lot of work\u2014not just any work, but a divine work. His work!\nNow, the good news is that it is precisely our Father in Heaven who has said, \u201cFor behold, this is *my work* and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\u201d\n\nPresident Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson\u2019s invitation to \u201cthink celestial\u201d implies a wonderful reminder of our divine nature, origin, and potential destination. We can obtain the celestial only through Jesus Christ\u2019s atoning sacrifice.\nPerhaps that is why Satan enticed Jesus with the very same temptation from the beginning to the end of His earthly ministry. Matthew recorded that while Jesus hung on the cross, those \u201cthat passed by reviled him, \u2026 saying, \u2026 *If thou be the Son of God*, come down from the cross.\u201d Glory be to God that He did not hearken but instead provided the way for us to receive all celestial blessings.\nLet us always remember, there was a great price paid for our happiness.\nI testify as with the Apostle Paul that \u201cthe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

        "full_markdown": "In 1996 the Nigerian men\u2019s football team won gold at the Olympic Games held in Atlanta in the United States. As the final ended, jubilant crowds poured onto the streets of every city and town in Nigeria; this country of 200 million people was instantly transformed into a massive celebration at two o\u2019clock in the morning! There was infectious joy, happiness, and excitement as people ate, sang, and danced. In that moment, Nigeria was united and every Nigerian was content being Nigerian.\nBefore the Olympics, this team faced numerous challenges. As the tournament began, their financial support ended. The team competed without proper kits, training venues, food, or laundry services.\n\n\n\nJerome Prevost/Getty Images\n\n\nAt one point, they were minutes away from being eliminated from competition, but the Nigerian team triumphed against all odds. This pivotal moment changed how they saw themselves. With newfound confidence, and with individual and team hard work and dogged determination, they unitedly ignored distractions and focused on winning. This focus earned them gold medals, and Nigerians christened them the \u201cDream Team.\u201d The Dream Team at the 1996 Olympics continues to be referenced in Nigerian sports.\n\n\n\nDavid Cannon/Allsport/Getty Images\n\n\nOnce the football team learned to ignore the many distractions facing them and focused on their goal, they succeeded beyond what they thought possible and experienced great joy. (As did the rest of us in Nigeria!)\nIn a similar way, when we ignore the distractions of the world and focus on Christ and His gospel, we are guaranteed success beyond what we can fully imagine and can feel great joy. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught: \u201cWhen the focus of our lives is on \u2026 Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening\u2014or not happening\u2014in our lives.\u201d\nI pray that the Holy Ghost will help each of us to heed President Nelson\u2019s invitation to focus our lives on \u201cJesus Christ and His gospel\u201d so we can experience joy in Christ \u201cregardless of what is happening\u2014or not happening\u2014in our lives.\u201d\nSeveral accounts in the Book of Mormon describe individuals who turned their lives around by focusing on Jesus Christ and His gospel.\nConsider Alma the Younger. He rebelled and fought against the Church. His father, Alma, prayed and fasted. An angel appeared and called Alma the Younger to repentance. In that moment, Alma began to suffer \u201cthe pains of a damned soul.\u201d In his darkest hours, he remembered his father teaching that Christ would come to atone for the sins of the world. As his mind caught hold on this thought, he pled with God for mercy. Joy was the result, a joy he described as exquisite! Mercy and joy came to Alma because he and his father focused on the Savior.\nFor parents with children who have strayed, take heart! Instead of wondering why an angel does not come to help your child repent, know that the Lord has placed a mortal angel in his or her path: the bishop, another Church leader, or a ministering brother or sister. If you keep fasting and praying, if you do not set a timetable or a deadline for God, and if you trust that He is stretching forth His hand to help, then\u2014sooner or later\u2014you find God touching the heart of your child when your child chooses to listen. This is so because Christ is joy\u2014Christ is hope; He is the promise \u201cof good things to come.\u201d So trust Jesus Christ with your child, for He is the strength of every parent and every child.\nOnce he experienced joy in Christ, Alma the Younger lived with that joy. But how did he maintain such joy even through difficulty and trial? He states:\n\u201cFrom that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, [to] bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201c\u2026 And \u2026 the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors.&nbsp;\u2026\n\u201cAnd I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind.\u201d\nJoy in Christ began for Alma when he exercised faith in Him and cried for mercy. Then Alma exercised his faith in Christ by laboring to help others taste of the same joy. These continuous labors produced great joy in Alma even in trials and troubles of every kind. You see, \u201cthe Lord loves effort,\u201d and effort focused on Him brings blessings. Even severe trials can be \u201cswallowed up in the joy of Christ.\u201d\nAnother group in the Book of Mormon who made Jesus Christ and His gospel the focus of their lives and found joy are those who founded the city Helam\u2014a place where they could raise their children and enjoy the free exercise of their religion. This righteous people living good lives were enslaved by a marauding group and stripped of the fundamental human right to exercise religion. Sometimes bad things happen to good people:\n\u201cThe Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.\n\u201cNevertheless\u2014whosoever putteth his trust in him the same shall be lifted up at the last day. Yea, and thus it was with this people.\u201d\nHow did this people endure through their trials and suffering? By focusing on Christ and His gospel. Their troubles did not define them; rather, each of them turned to God, likely defining themselves as a child of God, a child of the covenant, and a disciple of Jesus Christ. As they remembered who they were and called upon God, they received peace, strength, and ultimately joy in Christ:\n\u201cAlma and his people did \u2026 pour out their hearts to [God]; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.\u201d\nIn response, the Lord did \u201cease the burdens \u2026 upon [their] shoulders. \u2026 Yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with *patience to all the will of the Lord*.\u201d Note that these Saints let their troubles, suffering, and trials be swallowed up in the joy of Christ! Then in due time, He showed Alma the way for escape, and Alma\u2014a prophet of God\u2014led them to safety.\nAs we focus on Christ and follow His prophet, we too will be led to Christ and the joy of His gospel. President Nelson has taught: \u201cJoy is powerful, and focusing on joy brings God\u2019s power into our lives. As in all things, Jesus Christ is our ultimate exemplar, \u2018who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross\u2019 [[[Hebrews 12|Hebrews 12:2]]].\u201d\n\n\nMy mother recently passed away; it was a shock. I love my mother and did not plan on losing her so young. But through her passing, my family and I have experienced both sorrow and joy. I know because of Him, she is not dead\u2014she lives! And I know because of Christ and the priesthood keys restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, I will be with her again. The sorrow of losing my mom has been swallowed up in the joy of Christ! I am learning that to \u201cthink celestial\u201d and \u201clet God prevail\u201d includes focusing on the joy available in Christ.\nHe lovingly invites, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",

I urge you to study their messages. Use them as a litmus test of what is true and what is not during the next six months.\nThe preservation and renovation of the Salt Lake Temple and other areas on Temple Square have been underway for nearly five years. Present projections indicate that this work will be completed by the end of 2026. We are grateful for all who are working on this massive project.\nDuring the last six months, we have dedicated or rededicated nine temples in five countries. Between now and the end of the year, we will dedicate five more.\nToday we are pleased to announce plans to construct 17 more temples. Please listen reverently as I announce the locations.\n\n\nJuchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza, Mexico\n\n\nSanta Ana, El Salvador\n\n\nMedell\u00edn, Colombia\n\n\nSantiago, Dominican Republic\n\n\nPuerto Montt, Chile\n\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n\nMilan, Italy\n\n\nAbuja, Nigeria\n\n\nKampala, Uganda\n\n\nMaputo, Mozambique\n\n\nCoeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho\n\n\nQueen Creek, Arizona\n\n\nEl Paso, Texas\n\n\nHuntsville, Alabama\n\n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\n\n\nSummit, New Jersey\n\n\nPrice, Utah\n\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, do you see what is happening right before our eyes? I pray that we will not miss the majesty of this moment! The Lord is indeed hastening His work.\nWhy are we building temples at such an unprecedented pace? Why? Because the Lord has instructed us to do so. The blessings of the temple help to gather Israel on both sides of the veil. These blessings also help to prepare a people who will help prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Lord!\n\nAs the prophet Isaiah prophesied, and as memorialized in Handel\u2019s Messiah, when Jesus Christ returns, \u201cthe glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\u201d\nIn that day \u201cthe government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\u201d\nJesus Christ will govern from both old Jerusalem and the New Jerusalem \u201cbuilt upon the American continent.\u201d From these two centers, He will direct the affairs of His Church.\nIn that day the Lord will be known as \u201cKing of Kings, and Lord of Lords.\u201d Those who are with Him will be \u201ccalled, and chosen, and faithful.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, now is the time for you and for me to prepare for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ. Now is the time for us to make our discipleship our highest priority. In a world filled with dizzying distractions, how can we do this?\n\nRegular worship in the temple will help us. In the house of the Lord, we focus on Jesus Christ. We learn of Him. We make covenants to follow Him. We come to know Him. As we keep our temple covenants, we gain greater access to the Lord\u2019s strengthening power. In the temple, we receive protection from the buffetings of the world. We experience the pure love of Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father in great abundance! We feel peace and spiritual reassurance, in contrast to the turbulence of the world.\n*Here is my promise to you: Every sincere seeker of Jesus Christ will find Him in the temple.* You will feel His mercy. You will find answers to your most vexing questions. You will better comprehend the joy of His gospel.\nI have learned that the most crucial question we each must answer is this: To whom or to what will I give my life?\n\nMy decision to follow Jesus Christ is the most important decision I have ever made. During medical school, I gained a testimony of the divinity of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Since then our Savior has been the rock upon which I have built my life. That choice has made all the difference! That decision has made so many other decisions easier. That decision has given me purpose and direction. It has also helped me weather the storms of life. Let me share two examples:\nFirst, when my wife Dantzel unexpectedly passed away, I could not reach any of our children. There I was, alone, devastated, and crying out for help. Gratefully, through His Spirit, the Lord taught me why my dear Dantzel had been taken home. With that understanding, I was comforted. Over time, I was better able to cope with my grief. Later, I married my beloved wife Wendy. She was a central part of my second example.\nWhen Wendy and I were on assignment in a distant land, armed robbers put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. But the gun did not fire. Throughout that experience, both of our lives were threatened. Yet Wendy and I felt an undeniable peace. It was the peace \u201cwhich passeth all understanding.\u201d\nBrothers and sisters, the Lord will comfort you too! He will strengthen you. He will bless you with peace, even amidst chaos.\n\nPlease listen to this promise of Jesus Christ to you: \u201cI will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.\u201d\nThere is no limit to the Savior\u2019s capacity to help you. His incomprehensible suffering in Gethsemane and on Calvary was for you! His infinite Atonement is for you!\nI urge you to devote time each week\u2014for the rest of your life\u2014to increase your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. My heart aches for those who are mired in sin and don\u2019t know how to get out. I weep for those who struggle spiritually or who carry heavy burdens alone because they do not understand what Jesus Christ did for them.\nJesus Christ took upon Himself *your* sins, *your* pains, *your* heartaches, and *your* infirmities. You do not have to bear them alone! He will forgive you as you repent. He will bless you with what you need. He will heal your wounded soul. As you yoke yourself to Him, your burdens will feel lighter. If you will make and keep covenants to follow Jesus Christ, you will find that the painful moments of your life are temporary. Your afflictions will be \u201cswallowed up in the joy of Christ.\u201d\nIt is neither too early nor too late for you to become a devout disciple of Jesus Christ. Then you will experience fully the blessings of His Atonement. You will also be more effective in helping to gather Israel.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, in a coming day, Jesus Christ will return to the earth as the millennial Messiah. So today I call upon you to rededicate your lives to Jesus Christ. I call upon you to help gather scattered Israel and to prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Lord. I call upon you to talk of Christ, testify of Christ, have faith in Christ, and rejoice in Christ!\nCome unto Christ and \u201coffer your whole [soul]\u201d to Him. This is the secret to a life of joy!\nThe best is yet to come, my dear brothers and sisters, because the Savior is coming again! The best is yet to come because the Lord is hastening His work. The best is yet to come as we fully turn our hearts and our lives to Jesus Christ.\nI bear my solemn witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. I am His disciple. I am honored to be His servant. At His Second Coming, \u201cthe glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\u201d That day will be filled with joy for the righteous!\nThrough the power of the sacred priesthood keys I hold, I declare this truth to you and to all the world! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",
